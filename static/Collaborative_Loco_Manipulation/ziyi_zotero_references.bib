	abstract = {This paper presents a system for enabling real-time synthesis of whole-body locomotion and manipulation policies for real-world legged robots. Motivated by recent advancements in robot simulation, we leverage the efficient parallelization capabilities of the MuJoCo simulator to achieve fast sampling over the robot state and action trajectories. Our results show surprisingly effective real-world locomotion and manipulation capabilities with a very simple control strategy. We demonstrate our approach on several hardware and simulation experiments: robust locomotion over flat and uneven terrains, climbing over a box whose height is comparable to the robot, and pushing a box to a goal position. To our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of whole-body sampling-based MPC on real-world legged robot hardware.

	abstract = {Identifying the physical properties of the surrounding environment is essential for robotic locomotion and navigation to deal with non-geometric hazards, such as slippery and deformable terrains. It would be of great benefit for robots to anticipate these extreme physical properties before contact; however, estimating environmental physical parameters from vision is still an open challenge. Animals can achieve this by using their prior experience and knowledge of what they have seen and how it felt. In this work, we propose a cross-modal selfsupervised learning framework for vision-based environmental physical parameter estimation, which paves the way for future physical-property-aware locomotion and navigation. We bridge the gap between existing policies trained in simulation and identification of physical terrain parameters from vision. We propose to train a physical decoder in simulation to predict friction and stiffness from multi-modal input. The trained network allows the labeling of real-world images with physical parameters in a self-supervised manner to further train a visual network during deployment, which can densely predict the friction and stiffness from image data. We validate our physical decoder in simulation and the real world using a quadruped ANYmal robot, outperforming an existing baseline method. We show that our visual network can predict the physical properties in indoor and outdoor experiments while allowing fast adaptation to new environments},

By this collective behavior, some goals that are impossible for a single robot to achieve become feasible and attainable. There are several foreseen benefits of MRS compared to single robot systems such as the increased ability to resolve task complexity, increasing performance, reliability and simplicity in design. These benefits have attracted many researchers from academia and industry to investigate how to design and develop robust versatile MRS by solving a number of challenging problems such as complex task allocation, group formation, cooperative object detection and tracking, communication relaying and self-organization to name just a few. One of the most challenging problems of MRS is how to optimally assign a set of robots to a set of tasks in such a way that optimizes the overall system performance subject to a set of constraints. This problem is known as Multi-robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem. MRTA is a complex problem especially when it comes to heterogeneous unreliable robots equipped with different capabilities that are required to perform various tasks with different requirements and constraints in an optimal way. This chapter provides a comprehensive review on challenging aspects of MRTA problem, recent approaches to tackle this problem and the future directions.},

While it is possible to check for collisions at a point using standard algorithms, to date no practical method exists for computing C-free regions with rigorous certificates due to the complexity of mapping Cartesian-space obstacles through the kinematics. In this work, we present the first to our knowledge rigorous method for approximately decomposing a rational parametrization of C-free into certified polyhedral regions. Our method, called C-Iris (C-space Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite programming), generates large, convex polytopes in a rational parameterization of the configuration space which are rigorously certified to be collision-free. Such regions have been shown to be useful for both optimization-based and randomized motion planning. Based on convex optimization, our method works in arbitrary dimensions, only makes assumptions about the convexity of the obstacles in the 3D Cartesian space, and is fast enough to scale to realistic problems in manipulation. We demonstrate our algorithm?s ability to fill a non-trivial amount of collision-free C-space in several 2-DOF examples where the C-space can be visualized, as well as the scalability of our algorithm on a 7-DOF KUKA iiwa, a 6-DOF UR3e, and 12-DOF bimanual manipulators. An implementation of our algorithm is open-sourced in Drake. We furthermore provide examples of our algorithm in interactive Python notebooks.},

This approach not only decreases the computational time but also allows for effective scaling with more complex robot configurations, facilitating the integration of additional subsystems such as articulated arms on a quadruped robot. We demonstrate, through numerical evaluations, the convergence of our approach on two systems with increasing complexity. In addition, we showcase that our approach converges towards the same solution when compared to a state-of-the-art centralized whole-body MPC implementation. Moreover, we quantitatively compare the computational efficiency of our method to the centralized approach, revealing up to a 75{\textbackslash}\% reduction in computational time. Overall, our approach offers a promising avenue for accelerating MPC solutions for legged robots, paving the way for more effective utilization of the computational performance of modern hardware.},

	abstract = {Whether rigid or compliant, contact interactions are inherent to robot motions, enabling them to move or manipulate things. Contact interactions result from complex physical phenomena, that can be mathematically cast as Nonlinear Complementarity Problems (NCPs) in the context of rigid or compliant point contact interactions. Such a class of complementarity problems is, in general, difficult to solve both from an optimization and numerical perspective. Over the past decades, dedicated and specialized contact solvers, implemented in modern robotics simulators (e.g., Bullet, Drake, MuJoCo, DART, Raisim) have emerged. Yet, most of these solvers tend either to solve a relaxed formulation of the original contact problems (at the price of physical inconsistencies) or to scale poorly with the problem dimension or its numerical conditioning (e.g., a robotic hand manipulating a paper sheet). In this paper, we introduce a unified and efficient approach to solving NCPs in the context of contact simulation. It relies on a sound combination of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and proximal algorithms to account for both compliant and rigid contact interfaces in a unified way. To handle illconditioned problems and accelerate the convergence rate, we also propose an efficient update strategy to adapt the ADMM hyperparameters automatically. By leveraging proximal methods, we also propose new algorithmic solutions to efficiently evaluate the inverse dynamics involving rigid and compliant contact interactions, extending the approach developed in MuJoCo. We validate the efficiency and robustness of our contact solver against several alternative contact methods of the literature and benchmark them on various robotics and granular mechanics scenarios. Overall, the proposed approach is shown to be competitive against classic methods for simple contact problems and outperforms existing solutions on more complex scenarios, involving tens of contacts and poor conditioning.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the challenge of terrainadaptive dynamic locomotion in humanoid robots, a problem traditionally tackled by optimization-based methods or reinforcement learning (RL). Optimization-based methods, such as model-predictive control, excel in finding optimal reaction forces and achieving agile locomotion, especially in quadruped, but struggle with the nonlinear hybrid dynamics of legged systems and the real-time computation of step location, timing, and reaction forces. Conversely, RL-based methods show promise in navigating dynamic and rough terrains but are limited by their extensive data requirements. We introduce a novel locomotion architecture that integrates a neural network policy, trained through RL in simplified environments, with a state-of-the-art motion controller combining model-predictive control (MPC) and whole-body impulse control (WBIC). The policy efficiently learns high-level locomotion strategies, such as gait selection and step positioning, without the need for full dynamics simulations. This control architecture enables humanoid robots to dynamically navigate discrete terrains, making strategic locomotion decisions (e.g., walking, jumping, and leaping) based on ground height maps. Our results demonstrate that this integrated control architecture achieves dynamic locomotion with significantly fewer training samples than conventional RLbased methods and can be transferred to different humanoid platforms without additional training. The control architecture has been extensively tested in dynamic simulations, accomplishing terrain height-based dynamic locomotion for three different robots.},

In this paper, we propose an approach to detect collision without the additional sensor based on the momentum observer.

	abstract = {Legged robots have the potential to traverse a wide variety of environments, but are currently too unreliable to use in mission critical settings. A major factor that hinders the reliability of legged robots is the hybrid dynamics that arises when their legs make varying contact with the environment. The discontinuities introduced by hybrid dynamics interfere with traditional tracking, planning, and state estimation strategies. This thesis presents several novel ideas and tools in overcoming these difficulties: creating robust trajectories through optimally convergent planning, a tutorial on the saltation matrix (the update to the sensitivity equation for hybrid transitions), Kalman filtering on hybrid systems, iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator for hybrid systems, and a model predictive controller which can continuously update the current plan given new information. Optimally convergent planning creates trajectories that are robust to state uncertainty in undersensed and underactuated systems. Convergent planning utilizes ideas from contraction analysis and minimizes divergence to find trajectories that naturally shrink state uncertainty. This optimization framework is validated for an undersensed hill navigation problem as well as an underactuated rotary cart pole incline. The saltation matrix tutorial provides the necessary information to get started implementing smooth tools for hybrid systems with event-triggered transitions. The tutorial contains a survey of where the saltation matrix is commonly used, as well as expanded proofs for deriving the saltation matrix. We also show an example saltation matrix calculation for a simple rigid body system and show that vital information is lost when not using the saltation matrix, and we calculate the saltation matrix for a generalized rigid body system with unilateral constraints. The Kalman filter is a widely used optimal state estimation algorithm. We extended the Kalman filter to hybrid systems by creating the “Salted Kalman Filter” which allows hybrid transitions to occur during the a priori and a posteriori updates and by using linearizations about a hybrid transition in order to propagate uncertainty belief. The Salted Kalman Filter is compared against a version of the algorithm but with a naive method of linearization about hybrid transitions. The Salted Kalman Filter is also validated by comparing it against a hybrid particle filter benchmark. Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) is a trajectory optimization algorithm that uses locally linear models of the dynamics and uses a quadratic cost function. We extended iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator to hybrid systems with the following additions: allowing for hybrid transitions on the forward pass, handling mode mismatches with extensions on reference trajectories, and using the linearization about a hybrid transition on the backward pass. We validate the hybrid iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator on a variety of hybrid systems and show that the algorithm can optimally choose contact timing and placements. We utilize hybrid iLQR as a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) in order to replan in realtime. By replanning in real-time, the robot will be more robust to unplanned, large disturbances because the controller can generate a new plan instead of rigidly tracking a reference trajectory. We validated the MPC on a quadruped robot both in simulation and on the real robot by applying disturbances to the robot, and we also compared the MPC against an MPC that uses simplified robot dynamics. Overall, this thesis makes legged robots more reliable by creating a robust global plan and by reactively replanning in real time to deal with local disturbances such as contact timing errors or unplanned slips. Robustness to the global plan can be achieved through planning convergent trajectories. To alleviate the complexity of hybrid transitions, we heavily utilize linearizations to enable reactive replanning and fast state estimation through hybrid iLQR MPC and the Salted Kalman Filter.},

	abstract = {Legged robots require a robust and fast responding feet contact detection strategy. Common force sensors are often too heavy and can be easily damaged during impacts with the terrain. Therefore, it is desirable to detect a contact without a force sensor. This paper introduces a probabilistic contact detection strategy which considers full dynamics and differential/forward kinematics to maximize the use of available information for contact estimation. This papers shows that such strategy is much more accurate than the state-of-theart strategy that only take one measure into account, with a quadrupedal robot.},

A fundamental component of a state estimator in legged platforms is Leg Odometry, which only requires information about kinematics and contacts. Many legged robots use dedicated sensors on each foot to detect ground contacts. However, this choice is impractical for many agile legged robots in ﬁeld operations, as these sensors often degrade and break. Instead, this paper focuses on the development of a robust Leg Odometry module, which does not require contact sensors. The module estimates the probability of reliable contact and detects foot impacts using internal force sensing. This knowledge is then used to improve the kinematics-inertial state estimate of the robot’s base. We show how our approach can reach comparable performance to systems with foot sensors. Extensive experimental results lasting over 1 h are presented on our 85 kg quadrupedal robot HyQ carrying out a variety of gaits.},

Being able to detect slippage at the very beginning and promptly recover the traction is crucial for body stability and can make the difference in a situation where falling is not an option. Indeed, the majority of locomotion controllers and state estimation algorithms rely on the assumption that the stance feet are not slipping. The following work presents a methodology for slip detection and estimation of the friction parameters, plus a recovery strategy which exploits the capabilities of a whole body controller, implemented for locomotion, which optimizes for the ground reaction forces (GRFs). The estimation makes use only of proprioceptive sensors (no vision). Even though the essence of the approach is quite general, the implementation is specialized for the quadruped robot HyQ. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while walking on challenging terrains (a slippery ramp or an ice slab).},

The simulation results show that the average RMS estimation errors of the thigh, knee, and ankle angles are 0.007, 0.015, and 0.465 rad with the use of four, two, and one measurements respectively.

In this paper, we present a novel method for estimating unknown contact forces exerted on a robot manipulator. The force estimation method is divided into two steps. The ﬁrst step is to identify a robot dynamics model. A parametric model is derived ﬁrst based on rigid-body dynamic (RBD) theory. To improve the model accuracy, a nonparametric compensator trained with multilayer perception (MLP) is added to compensate for errors of the RBD model. The result is a semiparametric model that provides better model accuracy than either the RBD model or the MLP model alone. The second step is to construct a force estimation observer. A novel estimation method called disturbance Kalman ﬁlter (DKF) is developed in this paper. The design of DKF based on a time-invariant composite system model is presented. DKF can take both manipulator’s dynamics model and disturbance’s dynamics model into account. As with Kalman ﬁlter, it can provide robust and accurate estimation against uncertainty. Simulation and experimental results, obtained using a six-degrees-of-freedom Kinova Jaco2 manipulator, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {State estimation, in particular estimation of the base position, orientation and velocity, plays a big role in the efficiency of legged robot stabilization. The estimation of the base state is particularly important because of its strong correlation with the underactuated dynamics, i.e. the evolution of center of mass and angular momentum. Yet this estimation is typically done in two phases, first estimating the base state, then reconstructing the center of mass from the robot model. The underactuated dynamics is indeed not properly observed, and any bias in the model would not be corrected from the sensors. While it has already been observed that force measurements make such a bias observable, these are often only used for a binary estimation of the contact state. In this paper, we propose to simultaneously estimate the base and the underactuation state by exploiting all measurements simultaneously. To this end, we propose several contributions to implement a complete state estimator using factor graphs. Contact forces altering the underactuated dynamics are pre-integrated using a novel adaptation of the IMU pre-integration method, which constitutes the principal contribution. IMU pre-integration is also used to estimate the positional motion of the base. Encoder measurements then participate to the estimation in two ways: by providing leg odometry displacements which contributes to the observability of IMU biases; and by relating the positional and centroidal states, thus connecting the whole graph and producing a tightly-coupled whole-body estimator. The validity of the approach is demonstrated on real data captured by the Solo12 quadruped robot.},

This is particularly true in highly dynamic situations where common simpliﬁcations like no-slip or quasi-static sliding are violated. Incorporating contact constraints requires care to address the numerical challenges associated with discontinuous dynamics, which make straightforward application of derivative-based techniques such as the Extended Kalman Filter impossible. In this paper, we derive an approximate maximum a posteriori estimator that can handle rigid body contact by explicitly imposing contact constraints in the observation update.

To increase the robustness of the ﬁlter, an outliers rejection methodology is included into the update step. Furthermore, we present the nonlinear observability analysis of the system, where, by considering the special nature of 3D rotations, we obtain a relatively simple form of the corresponding observability matrix. This yields, that, except for the global position and the yaw angle, all states are in general observable. This also holds if only one foot is in contact with the ground.

	abstract = {Recently, legged robots have been used for various purposes, such as exploring unknown terrain or interacting with the world. For control and planning legged systems during interactive operations, it is essential to estimate and respond to external forces. However, in legged system, it becomes difficult to estimate forces due to highly dynamic situations. There are several studies that use a force sensor on the foot and end effector, but these approaches have disadvantages in terms of cost and sustainability. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an improved method for estimating external forces without a force sensor. First, each leg force was obtained using the system dynamics of the robot with a disturbance observer. Then, by preintegration, it was tightly coupled with other sensors to estimate the pose and external force simultaneously. Despite the impact and slip, we estimate external forces accurately in standing and walking motions. Moreover, we compared pose estimation performance with VINS-Mono [1], and there is no significant accuracy degradation in spite of highly dynamic force residual.},

	abstract = {Legged robots are meant to autonomously navigate unstructured environments for applications like search and rescue, inspection, or maintenance. In autonomous navigation, a close relationship between locomotion and perception is crucial; the robot has to perceive the environment and detect any change in order to autonomously make decisions based on what it perceived. One main challenge in autonomous navigation for legged robots is locomotion over unstructured terrains. In particular, when the ground is slippery, common control techniques and state estimation algorithms may not be effective, because the ground is commonly assumed to be non-slippery. This paper addresses the problem of slip detection, a first fundamental step to implement appropriate control strategies and perform dynamic whole-body locomotion. We propose a slip detection approach, which is independent of the gait type and the estimation of the position and velocity of the robot in an inertial frame, that is usually prone to drift problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach of a quadruped robot slip detector that can detect more than one foot slippage at the same time, relying on the estimation of measurements expressed in a non-inertial frame. We validate the approach on the 90 kg Hydraulically actuated Quadruped robot (HyQ) from the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), and we compare it against a state-of-the-art slip detection algorithm.},

An Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) is implemented to fuse inertial and velocity measurements from a tracking camera and leg kinematic constraints. The misalignment between the camera and the robot-frame is also modeled thus enabling auto-calibration of camera pose. The leg kinematics based velocity measurement is formulated as a right-invariant observation. Nonlinear observability analysis shows that other than the rotation around the gravity vector and the absolute position, all states are observable except for some singular cases. Discrete observability analysis demonstrates that our filter is consistent with the underlying nonlinear system. An online noise parameter tuning method is developed to adapt to the highly time-varying camera measurement noise. The proposed method is experimentally validated on a Cassie bipedal robot walking over slippery terrain. A video for the experiment can be found at https://youtu.be/VIqJL0cUr7s.},

Because the proposed smoother is formulated with the residual functions with group-afﬁne property, their Jacobians become independent from current state estimates. These state-independent Jacobians lead to better convergence properties in optimizing the cost in the smoother, especially under dynamic contact events. The proposed slip rejection method increases the uncertainty of static contact assumption when the robot has dynamic contact events. The estimated foot velocity, which is utilized to detect the dynamic contact events, is re-evaluated within the preserving time window. We also propose the contact loop method, a new measurement model asserting that foot position remains constant over multiple timesteps during stable contact. The proposed estimator is tested through online experiments, including indoor and 160 m-long outdoor experiments, and compared against state-of-the-art algorithms.},

	abstract = {The quality of the visual feedback can vary significantly on a legged robot that is meant to traverse unknown and unstructured terrains. The map of the environment, acquired with online state-of-the-art algorithms, often degrades after a few steps, due to sensing inaccuracies, slippage and unexpected disturbances. When designing locomotion algorithms, this degradation can result in planned trajectories that are not consistent with the reality, if not dealt properly. In this work, we propose a heuristic-based planning approach that enables a quadruped robot to successfully traverse a significantly rough terrain (e.g., stones up to 10 cm of diameter), in absence of visual feedback. When available, the approach allows also to exploit the visual feedback (e.g., to enhance the stepping strategy) in multiple ways, according to the quality of the 3D map. The proposed framework also includes reflexes, triggered in specific situations, and the possibility to estimate online an unknown time-varying disturbance and compensate for it. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with experiments performed on our quadruped robot HyQ (85 kg), traversing different terrains, such as: ramps, rocks, bricks, pallets and stairs. We also demonstrate the capability to estimate and compensate for disturbances, showing the robot walking up a ramp while pulling a cart attached to its back.},

However, most robot arms are not equipped with adequate sensors to detect contacts on their entire body. What many robot arms do have is torque sensors for individual joints. Through a quantitative analysis, we argue that it is fairly likely for two distinct contacts on the robot’s surface to generate almost identical joint torque measurements. When this happens, the best contact estimate achievable is the set of possible contact positions, all of which would reproduce the measured joint torque. Searching for elements of this set is equivalent to solving to global optimality a nonlinear program. By combining rejection sampling with gradient descent, we propose a contact estimation method which in practice ﬁnds all local optima of the nonlinear program at real-time rates. In addition, we propose an active contact exploration method which falsiﬁes spurious contact estimates in the set of local optima by making small motions around the robot’s current conﬁguration. The proposed methods highlight the caveats of contact estimation from only joint torque, which, coupled with known limitations of such estimators, suggest that a more capable sensor is probably needed for robust whole-body contact estimation.},

Here we present a “contact-aware” controller which continues to execute a given trajectory despite unexpected collisions while keeping the contact force stable and small. We introduce a quadratic programming (QP) formulation, which minimizes a trajectorytracking error subject to quasistatic dynamics and contact-force constraints. Compared with the classical null-space projection technique, the inequality constraint on contact forces in the proposed QP controller allows for more gentle release when the robot comes out of contact. In the quasistatic dynamics model, control actions consist only of commanded joint positions, allowing the QP controller to run on stiffness-controlled robots which do not have a straightforward torque-control interface nor accurate dynamic models. The effectiveness of the proposed QP controller is demonstrated on a KUKA iiwa arm. Project video: https://youtu.be/M-7JMQRkiPk.},

	abstract = {In the literature on robotics and multibody dynamics, the concept of average angular velocity has received considerable attention in recent years. We address the question of whether the average angular velocity deﬁnes an orientation frame that depends only on the current robot conﬁguration and provide a simple algebraic condition to check whether this holds. In the language of geometric mechanics, this condition corresponds to requiring the ﬂatness of the mechanical connection associated with the robotic system. Here, however, we provide both a reinterpretation and a proof of this result accessible to readers with a background in rigid body kinematics and multibody dynamics but not necessarily acquainted with differential geometry, still providing precise links to the geometric mechanics literature. This should help spreading the algebraic condition beyond the scope of geometric mechanics, contributing to a proper utilization and understanding of the concept of average angular velocity.},

The goal of this survey is to cover the recent progress toward these applications that has been driven by model-based optimization for the real-time generation and control of movement. The majority of the research community has converged on the idea of generating locomotion control laws by solving an optimal control problem (OCP) in either a model-based or data-driven manner. However, solving the most general of these problems online remains intractable due to complexities from intermittent unidirectional contacts with the environment, and from the many degrees of freedom of legged robots. This survey covers methods that have been pursued to make these OCPs computationally tractable, with speciﬁc focus on how environmental contacts are treated, how the model can be simpliﬁed, and how these choices affect the numerical solution methods employed. The survey focuses on model-based optimization while paving its way for broader combination with learning-based formulations to accelerate progress in this growing ﬁeld.},

However, more agile underactuated bipeds have small feet and weak ankles, and must constantly adjust their planned footstep position to maintain balance. We introduce a new model-predictive footstep controller which jointly optimizes over the robot's discrete choice of stepping surface, impending footstep position sequence, ankle torque in the sagittal plane, and center of mass trajectory, to track a velocity command. The controller is formulated as a single Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) which is solved at 50-200 Hz, depending on terrain complexity. We implement a state of the art real-time elevation mapping and convex terrain decomposition framework to inform the controller of its surroundings in the form on convex polygons representing steppable terrain.

	abstract = {This paper presents a layered control approach for real-time trajectory planning and control of robust cooperative locomotion by two holonomically constrained quadrupedal robots. A novel interconnected network of reduced-order models, based on the single rigid body (SRB) dynamics, is developed for trajectory planning purposes. At the higher level of the control architecture, two different model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are proposed to address the optimal control problem of the interconnected SRB dynamics: centralized and distributed MPCs. The distributed MPC assumes two local quadratic programs that share their optimal solutions according to a one-step communication delay and an agreement protocol. At the lower level of the control scheme, distributed nonlinear controllers are developed to impose the full-order dynamics to track the prescribed reduced-order trajectories generated by MPCs. The effectiveness of the control approach is verified with extensive numerical simulations and experiments for the robust and cooperative locomotion of two holonomically constrained A1 robots with different payloads on variable terrains and in the presence of disturbances. It is shown that the distributed MPC has a performance similar to that of the centralized MPC, while the computation time is reduced significantly.},

Problems of this form arise naturally in many areas, from motion planning of autonomous vehicles to optimal control of hybrid systems. The price for such a wide applicability is the complexity of this problem, which is easily seen to be NP-hard. Our main contribution is a strong and lightweight mixed-integer convex formulation based on perspective operators, that makes it possible to efficiently find globally optimal paths in large graphs and in high-dimensional spaces.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04422},
	abstract = {Trajectory optimization offers mature tools for motion planning in high-dimensional spaces under dynamic constraints. However, when facing complex configuration spaces, cluttered with obstacles, roboticists typically fall back to sampling-based planners that struggle in very high dimensions and with continuous differential constraints. Indeed, obstacles are the source of many textbook examples of problematic nonconvexities in the trajectory-optimization problem. Here we show that convex optimization can, in fact, be used to reliably plan trajectories around obstacles. Specifically, we consider planning problems with collision-avoidance constraints, as well as cost penalties and hard constraints on the shape, the duration, and the velocity of the trajectory. Combining the properties of B{\textbackslash}'ezier curves with a recently-proposed framework for finding shortest paths in Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS), we formulate the planning problem as a compact mixed-integer optimization. In stark contrast with existing mixed-integer planners, the convex relaxation of our programs is very tight, and a cheap rounding of its solution is typically sufficient to design globally-optimal trajectories. This reduces the mixed-integer program back to a simple convex optimization, and automatically provides optimality bounds for the planned trajectories. We name the proposed planner GCS, after its underlying optimization framework. We demonstrate GCS in simulation on a variety of robotic platforms, including a quadrotor flying through buildings and a dual-arm manipulator (with fourteen degrees of freedom) moving in a confined space. Using numerical experiments on a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator, we show that GCS can outperform widely-used sampling-based planners by finding higher-quality trajectories in less time.},

	abstract = {Offline evolutionary-based methodologies have supplied a successful motion planning framework for the quadrupedal jump. However, the time-consuming computation caused by massive population evolution in offline evolutionary-based jumping framework significantly limits the popularity in the quadrupedal field. This paper presents a time-friendly online motion planning framework based on meta-heuristic Differential evolution (DE), Latin hypercube sampling, and Configuration space (DLC). The DLC framework establishes a multidimensional optimization problem leveraging centroidal dynamics to determine the ideal trajectory of the center of mass (CoM) and ground reaction forces (GRFs). The configuration space is introduced to the evolutionary optimization in order to condense the searching region. Latin hypercube sampling offers more uniform initial populations of DE under limited sampling points, accelerating away from a local minimum. This research also constructs a collection of pre-motion trajectories as a warm start when the objective state is in the neighborhood of the pre-motion state to drastically reduce the solving time. The proposed methodology is successfully validated via real robot experiments for online jumping trajectory optimization with different jumping motions (e.g., ordinary jumping, flipping, and spinning).},

These skills can be assessed on the basis of a system’s ability to coordinate complex holistic movements and multiple contact interactions when solving different tasks. However, existing approaches have been merely able to shape such behaviors with hand-crafted state machines, densely engineered rewards, or prerecorded expert demonstrations. Here, we propose a minimally guided framework that automatically discovers whole-body trajectories jointly with contact schedules for solving general loco-manipulation tasks in premodeled environments. The key insight is that multimodal problems of this nature can be formulated and treated within the context of integrated task and motion planning (TAMP). An effective bilevel search strategy was achieved by incorporating domain-specific rules and adequately combining the strengths of different planning techniques: trajectory optimization and informed graph search coupled with sampling-based planning. We showcase emergent behaviors for a quadrupedal mobile manipulator exploiting both prehensile and nonprehensile interactions to perform real-world tasks such as opening/closing heavy dishwashers and traversing spring-loaded doors. These behaviors were also deployed on the real system using a two-layer whole-body tracking controller.},

	abstract = {This study proposes a hierarchically integrated framework for safe task and motion planning (TAMP) of bipedal locomotion in a partially observable environment with dynamic obstacles and uneven terrain. The high-level task planner employs linear temporal logic for a reactive game synthesis between the robot and its environment and provides a formal guarantee on navigation safety and task completion. To address environmental partial observability, a belief abstraction model is designed by partitioning the environment into multiple belief regions and employed at the high-level navigation planner to estimate the dynamic obstacles' location. This additional location information of dynamic obstacles offered by belief abstraction enables less conservative long-horizon navigation actions beyond guaranteeing immediate collision avoidance. Accordingly, a synthesized action planner sends a set of locomotion actions to the middle-level motion planner while incorporating safe locomotion specifications extracted from safety theorems based on a reduced-order model (ROM) of the locomotion process. The motion planner employs the ROM to design safety criteria and a sampling algorithm to generate nonperiodic motion plans that accurately track high-level actions. At the low level, a foot placement controller based on an angular-momentum linear inverted pendulum model is implemented and integrated with an ankle-actuated passivity-based controller for full-body trajectory tracking. To address external perturbations, this study also investigates the safe sequential composition of the keyframe locomotion state and achieves robust transitions against external perturbations through reachability analysis. The overall TAMP framework is validated with extensive simulations and hardware experiments on bipedal walking robots Cassie and Digit designed by Agility Robotics.},

	abstract = {Legged robots are increasingly entering new domains and applications, including search and rescue, inspection, and logistics. However, for such a systems to be valuable in real-world scenarios, they must be able to autonomously and robustly navigate irregular terrains. In many cases, robots that are sold on the market do not provide such abilities, being able to perform only blind locomotion. Furthermore, their controller cannot be easily modified by the end-user, requiring a new and time-consuming control synthesis. In this work, we present a fast local motion planning pipeline that extends the capabilities of a black-box walking controller that is only able to track high-level reference velocities. More precisely, we learn a set of motion models for such a controller that maps high-level velocity commands to Center of Mass (CoM) and footstep motions. We then integrate these models with a variant of the A∗ algorithm to plan the CoM trajectory, footstep sequences, and corresponding high-level velocity commands based on visual information, allowing the quadruped to safely traverse irregular terrains at demand.},

The contact sequence and timings constitute a hybrid dynamical system and prescribe a subset of achievable motions. State-of-the-art approaches cast motion planning as an optimal control problem. In order to decrease computational complexity, one common strategy separates footstep planning from motion optimization and plans contacts using heuristics. In this paper, we propose to learn contact schedule selection from high-level task descriptors using Bayesian optimization. A bi-level optimization is defined in which a Gaussian process model predicts the performance of trajectories generated by a motion planning nonlinear program. The agent, therefore, retains the ability to reason about suitable contact schedules, while explicit computation of the corresponding gradients is avoided. We delineate the algorithm in its general form and provide results for planning single-legged hopping. Our method is capable of learning contact schedule transitions that align with human intuition. It performs competitively against a heuristic baseline in predicting task appropriate contact schedules.},

A key point in the design of our algorithm is the calculation of contact-stability constraints. Thanks to a mathematical observation on the algebraic nature of the frictional wrench cone, we show that the 3D volume of feasible COM accelerations is always an upward-pointing cone. We reduce its computation to a convex hull of (dual) 2D points, for which optimal C(n log n) algorithms are readily available. This reformulation brings a significant speedup compared to previous methods, which allows us to compute time-varying contact-stability criteria fast enough for the control loop. Next, we propose a conservative trajectory-wide contact-stability criterion, which can be derived from COM-acceleration volumes at marginal cost and directly applied in a model-predictive controller. We finally implement this pipeline and exemplify it with the HRP-4 humanoid model in multi-contact dynamically walking scenarios.},

I will automatically encode robot skills in the Generalized Reactivity (1) (GR(1)) fragment of Linear Temporal Logic. Given the robot skills and an infeasible user-provided task encoded in GR(1), I will present methods to symbolically modify the robot skills to make the task feasible. Furthermore, I will explore feedback between the automatic symbolic and physical modification of skills. I will demonstrate these methods on both simulated and physical robots, including a Baxter and a Clearpath Jackal.},

In this paper we consider LTL specifications that cannot be synthesized into robot control due to lack of appropriate skills; we present algorithms for automatically suggesting new or modified skills for the robot that will guarantee the task will be achieved.

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive formulation to the problem of controlling a high-dimensional robotic system involving complex tasks subject to a variety of constraints, obstacles, balance, and contact challenges. Using intuitive and natural representations, the approach is initiated by establishing individual objectives for a task and its constraints. Simple independent controllers using artificial potential fields are then designed for each objective to reach goals while enforcing the constraints. Dynamically consistent projections in nullspaces associated with task and constraint representations are employed to deliver a coherent whole-body robot control. In multi-link multi-contact tasks, contact forces produce both resulting and internal forces. Internal forces play a critical role in robot balance and stability, achieved in this framework through modeling and controlling virtual linkages that explicitly describe the relationship between active/passive contact force, resultant force, controlled/uncontrolled internal force for multi-link multi-contact underactuated robots. Control of contacts with the environment involves material considerations such as friction and geometric constraints. Potential barriers direct the selection of contact forces ensuring stability and balance. This approach of dynamic projection and the Virtual Linkage Model addresses robot underactuation. In addition, the framework introduces a coordinate completion mechanism to establish a generalized coordinates representation of the task, removing redundancy and maintaining the full operational space dynamics description. This enables task-space dynamic control based on the relevant inertial properties. We present the experimental validation on a physical humanoid platform.},

	abstract = {Our paper proposes a direct sparse visual odometry method that combines event and RGB-D data to estimate the pose of agile-legged robots during dynamic locomotion and acrobatic behaviors. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and dynamic range, which can eliminate the issue of blurred RGB images during fast movements. This unique strength holds a potential for accurate pose estimation of agile-legged robots, which has been a challenging problem to tackle. Our framework leverages the beneﬁts of both RGBD and event cameras to achieve robust and accurate pose estimation, even during dynamic maneuvers such as jumping and landing a quadruped robot, the Mini-Cheetah. Our major contributions are threefold: Firstly, we introduce an adaptive time surface (ATS) method that addresses the whiteout and blackout issue in conventional time surfaces by formulating pixel-wise decay rates based on scene complexity and motion speed. Secondly, we develop an effective pixel selection method that directly samples from event data and applies sample ﬁltering through ATS, enabling us to pick pixels on distinct features. Lastly, we propose a nonlinear pose optimization formula that simultaneously performs 3D-2D alignment on both RGB-based and event-based maps and images, allowing the algorithm to fully exploit the beneﬁts of both data streams. We extensively evaluate the performance of our framework on both public datasets and our own quadruped robot dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately estimating the pose of agile robots during dynamic movements.},

The burden of careful engineering of cost functions to achieve desired performance is substantially mitigated by a simple inverse optimal control technique. Robustness is achieved by real-time re-planning of the full trajectory, augmented by reﬂexes and feedback control.

We ﬁrst use the high-level planner to ﬁnd a sequence of ﬁnger contact switches given a desired object trajectory. With this contact sequence plan, we impose additional constraints in the CITO problem. We show that our method ﬁnds trajectories approximately 7 times faster than a general CITO baseline for a four-ﬁnger planar manipulation scenario. Furthermore, when executing the planned trajectories in a full dynamics simulator, we are able to more closely track the object pose trajectories planned by our method than those planned by the baselines.},

	abstract = {Although Trajectory Optimization (TO) is one of the most powerful motion planning tools, it suffers from expensive computational complexity as a time horizon increases in cluttered environments. It can also fail to converge to a globally optimal solution. In this paper, we present Lazy Trajectory Optimization (LTO) that unifies local short-horizon TO and global Graph-Search Planning (GSP) to generate a long-horizon global optimal trajectory. LTO solves TO with the same constraints as the original long-horizon TO with improved time complexity. We also propose a TO-aware cost function that can balance both solution cost and planning time. Since LTO solves many nearly identical TO in a roadmap, it can provide an informed warm-start for TO to accelerate the planning process. We also present proofs of the computational complexity and optimality of LTO. Finally, we demonstrate LTO's performance on motion planning problems for a 2 DOF free-flying robot and a 21 DOF legged robot, showing that LTO outperforms existing algorithms in terms of its runtime and reliability.

Current pose adaptation strategies optimize the robot's body pose relative to given footholds. If these footholds are not reached, the robot may end up in a state with no reachable safe footholds. Therefore, we present a vision-based terrain-aware locomotion (ViTAL) strategy that consists of novel pose adaptation and foothold selection algorithms. ViTAL introduces a different paradigm in pose adaptation that does not optimize the body pose relative to given footholds, but the body pose that maximizes the chances of the legs in reaching safe footholds. ViTAL plans footholds and poses based on skills that characterize the robot's capabilities and its terrain awareness. We use the 90-kg HyQ and 140-kg HyQReal quadruped robots to validate ViTAL and show that they are able to climb various obstacles, including stairs, gaps, and rough terrains, at different speeds and gaits. We compare ViTAL with a baseline strategy that selects the robot pose based on given selected footholds and show that ViTAL outperforms the baseline.},

Our framework is based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and has three levels: 1) planning object motions and environment contact modes; 2) planning robot contacts; 3) path evaluation and control optimization that passes the rewards to the upper levels. This framework offers two main advantages. First, it allows efficient global reasoning over high-dimensional complex space created by contacts. It solves a diverse set of manipulation tasks that require dexterity, both intrinsic (using the fingers) and extrinsic (also using the environment), mostly in seconds. Second, our framework allows the incorporation of expert knowledge and customizable setups in task mechanics and models. It requires minor modifications to accommodate different scenarios and robots. Hence, it could provide a flexible and generalizable solution for various manipulation tasks. As examples, we analyze the results on 7 hand configurations and 15 scenarios.

	abstract = {Rigid body dynamics is a well-established frame-work in robotics. It can be used to expose the analytic form of kinematic and dynamic functions of the robot model. So far, two major algorithms, namely the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm (RNEA) and the articulated body algorithm (ABA), have been proposed to compute the inverse dynamics and the forward dynamics in a few microseconds. Evaluating their derivatives is an important challenge for various robotic applications (optimal control, estimation, co-design or reinforcement learning). However it remains time consuming, whether using ﬁnite differences or automatic differentiation. In this paper, we propose new algorithms to efﬁciently compute them thanks to closed-form formulations. Using the chain rule and adequate algebraic differentiation of spatial algebra, we ﬁrstly differentiate explicitly RNEA. Then, using properties about the derivative of function composition, we show that the same algorithm can also be used to compute the derivatives of ABA with a marginal additional cost. For this purpose, we introduce a new algorithm to compute the inverse of the joint-space inertia matrix, without explicitly computing the matrix itself. All the algorithms are implemented in our open-source C++ framework called Pinocchio. Benchmarks show computational costs varying between 3 microseconds (for a 7-dof arm) up to 17 microseconds (for a 36-dof humanoid), outperforming the alternative approaches of the state of the art.},

	abstract = {Collision detection appears as a canonical operation in a large range of robotics applications from robot control to simulation, including motion planning and estimation. While the seminal works on the topic date back to the 80s, it is only recently that the question of properly differentiating collision detection has emerged as a central issue, thanks notably to the ongoing and various efforts made by the scientific community around the topic of differentiable physics. Yet, very few solutions have been suggested so far, and only with a strong assumption on the nature of the shapes involved. In this work, we introduce a generic and efficient approach to compute the derivatives of collision detection for any pair of convex shapes, by notably leveraging randomized smoothing techniques which have shown to be particularly adapted to capture the derivatives of non-smooth problems. This approach is implemented in the HPP-FCL and Pinocchio ecosystems, and evaluated on classic datasets and problems of the robotics literature, demonstrating few micro-second timings to compute informative derivatives directly exploitable by many real robotic applications including differentiable simulation.},

What is causing this gap, and how might we use the answer to improve gradient-based methods? We believe a stochastic formulation of dynamics is one crucial ingredient. We use tools from randomized smoothing to analyze sampling-based approximations of the gradient, and formalize such approximations through the gradient bundle. We show that using the gradient bundle in lieu of the gradient mitigates fast-changing gradients of non-smooth contact dynamics modeled by the implicit time-stepping, or the penalty method. Finally, we apply the gradient bundle to optimal control using iLQR, introducing a novel algorithm which improves convergence over using exact gradients. Combining our algorithm with a convex implicit time-stepping formulation of contact, we show that we can tractably tackle planning-through-contact problems in manipulation.},

	abstract = {The empirical success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the setting of contact-rich manipulation leaves much to be understood from a model-based perspective, where the key difficulties are often attributed to (i) the explosion of contact modes, (ii) stiff, non-smooth contact dynamics and the resulting exploding / discontinuous gradients, and (iii) the non-convexity of the planning problem. The stochastic nature of RL addresses (i) and (ii) by effectively sampling and averaging the contact modes. On the other hand, model-based methods have tackled the same challenges by smoothing contact dynamics analytically. Our first contribution is to establish the theoretical equivalence of the two methods for simple systems, and provide qualitative and empirical equivalence on a number of complex examples. In order to further alleviate (ii), our second contribution is a convex, differentiable and quasi-dynamic formulation of contact dynamics, which is amenable to both smoothing schemes, and has proven through experiments to be highly effective for contact-rich planning. Our final contribution resolves (iii), where we show that classical sampling-based motion planning algorithms can be effective in global planning when contact modes are abstracted via smoothing. Applying our method on a collection of challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that efficient model-based motion planning can achieve results comparable to RL with dramatically less computation.

The optimization-based stage ensures that all the system constraints, such as non-holonomic rolling constraints, are satisfied. The evaluations show the importance of good initial guesses for optimization. Furthermore, they suggest that terrain/collision (avoidance) constraints are more challenging than the robot model’s constraints.

	abstract = {This paper presents a feedback controller that allows MABEL, which is a kneed planar bipedal robot with 1-m-long legs, to accommodate terrain that presents large unexpected increases and decreases in height. The robot is provided no information regarding where the change in terrain height occurs and by how much. A finite-state machine is designed that manages transitions among controllers for flat-ground walking, stepping-up and -down, and a trip reflex. If the robot completes a step, the depth of a step-down or the height of a step-up can be immediately estimated at impact from the lengths of the legs and the angles of the robot’s joints. The change in height can be used to invoke a proper control response. On the other hand, if the swing leg impacts an obstacle during a step, or has a premature impact with the ground, a trip reflex is triggered on the basis of specially designed contact switches on the robot’s shins, contact switches at the end of each leg, and the current configuration of the robot. The design of each control mode and the transition conditions among them are presented. This paper concludes with experimental results of MABEL (blindly) accommodating various types of platforms, including ascent of a 12.5-cm-high platform, stepping-off an 18.5-cm-high platform, and walking over a platform with multiple ascending and descending steps.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional recurrent neural network that predicts action sequences for task and motion planning (TAMP) from an initial scene image. Typical TAMP problems are formalized by combining reasoning on a symbolic, discrete level (e.g. first-order logic) with continuous motion planning such as nonlinear trajectory optimization. Due to the great combinatorial complexity of possible discrete action sequences, a large number of optimization/motion planning problems have to be solved to find a solution, which limits the scalability of these approaches. To circumvent this combinatorial complexity, we develop a neural network which, based on an initial image of the scene, directly predicts promising discrete action sequences such that ideally only one motion planning problem has to be solved to find a solution to the overall TAMP problem. A key aspect is that our method generalizes to scenes with many and varying number of objects, although being trained on only two objects at a time. This is possible by encoding the objects of the scene in images as input to the neural network, instead of a fixed feature vector. Results show runtime improvements of several magnitudes.

	abstract = {Performing agile navigation with four-legged robots is a challenging task due to the highly dynamic motions, contacts with various parts of the robot, and the limited field of view of the perception sensors. In this paper, we propose a fully-learned approach to train such robots and conquer scenarios that are reminiscent of parkour challenges. The method involves training advanced locomotion skills for several types of obstacles, such as walking, jumping, climbing, and crouching, and then using a high-level policy to select and control those skills across the terrain. Thanks to our hierarchical formulation, the navigation policy is aware of the capabilities of each skill, and it will adapt its behavior depending on the scenario at hand. Additionally, a perception module is trained to reconstruct obstacles from highly occluded and noisy sensory data and endows the pipeline with scene understanding. Compared to previous attempts, our method can plan a path for challenging scenarios without expert demonstration, offline computation, a priori knowledge of the environment, or taking contacts explicitly into account. While these modules are trained from simulated data only, our real-world experiments demonstrate successful transfer on hardware, where the robot navigates and crosses consecutive challenging obstacles with speeds of up to two meters per second.

In this work, we consider the difficult problem of locomotion on challenging terrains using a single forward-facing depth camera.

To solve this problem, we follow the paradigm in computer vision that explicitly models the 3D geometry of the scene and propose Neural Volumetric Memory (NVM), a geometric memory architecture that explicitly accounts for the SE(3) equivariance of the 3D world. NVM aggregates feature volumes from multiple camera views by first bringing them back to the ego-centric frame of the robot. We test the learned visual-locomotion policy on a physical robot and show that our approach, which explicitly introduces geometric priors during training, offers superior performance than more na{\textbackslash}"ive methods. We also include ablation studies and show that the representations stored in the neural volumetric memory capture sufficient geometric information to reconstruct the scene.

To this end, external disturbances and body orientation errors should be identified, and appropriate actions have to be taken to restore the balance of the robot and to provide advantageous landing circumstances. This paper briefly surveys the developments for balance and posture control of legged robots.

This article proposes a free gait generation algorithm that only takes the robot state as input. Specifically, we introduce the feasible impulse polytope, which takes into account both linear and angular momentum impulses acting on the body in a prediction horizon. This naturally leads us to formulate a leg capability metric related to the effect of take-off and touch-down on the body motion. Then, gait sequence, take-off timing, and touch-down location can be automatically adjusted online as long as a metric threshold is given. To cope with rough terrain, a series of quadratic programming problems are established for online pose optimization under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we fully integrate the proposed algorithms with the robot control and estimation framework for real-time implementation. We first validate our approach with the quadruped robot SCIT-Dog through locomotion with speed changes, on stairs and slopes, and under lateral disturbances. Besides, a push-recovery experiment is established to show the superiority of the proposed approach over the baseline method with prespecified gait patterns. Experiment results verify the ability of the proposed algorithms to achieve autonomous gait transitions in response to various emergencies.},

It implements a hybrid approach that performs contact-implicit trajectory optimization for pivoting and sliding manipulation primitives and sampling-based planning to change between manipulation primitives and target object poses. The optimization method, simultaneous trajectory optimization and contact selection (STOCS), introduces an infinite programming framework to dynamically select from contact points and support forces between the object and environment during a manipulation primitive. To sequence manipulation primitives, a sampling-based tree-growing planner uses STOCS to construct a manipulation tree. We show that by using a powerful trajectory optimizer, the proposed planner can discover multi-modal manipulation trajectories involving grasping, sliding, and pivoting within a few dozen samples.

To this end, we present a complete multi-contact planning and control framework for multi-limbed robotic systems, such as humanoids. The planning layer works offline and consists of two sequential modules: first, a stance planner computes a sequence of feasible contact combinations; then, a whole-body planner finds the sequence of collision-free humanoid motions that realize them while respecting the physical limitations of the robot. For the challenging problem posed by the first stage, we propose a novel randomized approach that does not require the specification of pre-designed potential contacts or any kind of pre-computation. The control layer produces online torque commands that enable the humanoid to execute the planned motions while guaranteeing closed-loop balance. It relies on two modules, i.e., the stance switching and reactive balancing module; their combined action allows it to withstand possible execution inaccuracies, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties.

	abstract = {Quadruped animals seamlessly transition between gaits as they change locomotion speeds. While the most widely accepted explanation for gait transitions is energy efficiency, there is no clear consensus on the determining factor, nor on the potential effects from terrain properties. In this article, we propose that viability, i.e. the avoidance of falls, represents an important criterion for gait transitions. We investigate the emergence of gait transitions through the interaction between supraspinal drive (brain), the central pattern generator in the spinal cord, the body, and exteroceptive sensing by leveraging deep reinforcement learning and robotics tools. Consistent with quadruped animal data, we show that the walk-trot gait transition for quadruped robots on flat terrain improves both viability and energy efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of discrete terrain (i.e. crossing successive gaps) on imposing gait transitions, and find the emergence of trot-pronk transitions to avoid non-viable states. Compared with other potential criteria such as peak forces and energy efficiency, viability is the only improved factor after gait transitions on both flat and discrete gap terrains, suggesting that viability could be a primary and universal objective of gait transitions, while other criteria are secondary objectives and/or a consequence of viability. Moreover, we deploy our learned controller in sim-to-real hardware experiments and demonstrate state-of-the-art quadruped agility in challenging scenarios, where the Unitree A1 quadruped autonomously transitions gaits between trot and pronk to cross consecutive gaps of up to 30 cm (83.3 \% of the body-length) at over 1.3 m/s.},

Hence, to recover from falls and achieve all-terrain traversability, it is essential for intelligent robots to possess the complex motor skills required to resume operation. To go beyond the limitation of handcrafted control, we investigated a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn generalized feedback-control policies for fall recovery that are robust to external disturbances. We proposed a design guideline for selecting key states for initialization, including a comparison to the random state initialization. The proposed learning-based pipeline is applicable to different robot models and their corner cases, including both small-/large-size bipeds and quadrupeds. Further, we show that the learned fall recovery policies are hardware-feasible and can be implemented on real robots.},

We present a novel hierarchical vision navigation system combining foothold adaptation policy with locomotion control of the quadruped robots.

Meanwhile, the low-level policy trains the foothold adaptation network through auto-annotated supervised learning to adjust the locomotion controller and to provide more feasible foot placement.

These methods formulate contact as complementarity constraints and require solving a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). However, MPCC solve times increase steeply with the number of variables and complementarity constraints, which limits their applicability to problems with low geometric complexity. This paper introduces the simultaneous trajectory optimization and contact selection (STOCS) method that embeds the detection of salient contact points and contact times inside trajectory optimization. Because the number of active contact points is usually small, this approach minimize the number of MPCC variables and constraints, which makes solving manipulation trajectories for objects with complex, non-convex geometry computationally tractable. The proposed approach is validated on a pivoting problem in simulation and on a 6 DoF manipulator arm.},

	abstract = {Navigation is a crucial component of any mobile robot. For humanoid robots, this task is more challenging than for wheeled robots. Their capabilities can not be modeled by the velocity and acceleration limits used for wheeled navigation, as the discrete nature of taking steps interferes with the assumption that acceleration is possible at any time. Footstep planning can provide a viable alternative. It enables the robot to step onto or over obstacles and navigate more precisely as it considers individual footstep placement. However, modeling the capabilities of where a robot can place its feet while remaining stable given a specific walking engine and the robot’s dynamic state is challenging. This thesis proposes using a model-free reinforcement learning approach to train a policy that outputs the footstep poses for a walking engine. This allows learning the capabilities of the robot and the walking engine to minimize the time required for navigation. The policy is trained and evaluated in simulation. However, the employed walking engine has been used successfully on several real robots, which could ease the sim-to-real transfer. The evaluation shows a significant performance increase compared to velocity-based navigation while still being robust to noisy measurements.},

This article proposes an online optimization method to realize a vertical jump with centroidal angular momentum (CAM) control and landing impact absorption for a humanoid robot. First, the robot's center of mass (CoM) trajectory is generated by nonlinear optimization. Then, a quasi-sliding mode controller is designed to ensure that the robot tracks the CoM trajectory accurately. To avoid unexpected spinning in the flight phase, a center-of-pressure-guided angular momentum controller is designed to stabilize the CAM. The modifications of CoM and CAM are realized by online optimization of dynamic components and inverse dynamics. Two quadratic programming optimizations are utilized to generate feasible contact force/torque and joint acceleration referring to uplevel CoM and CAM controllers. In addition, a viscoelastic model-based controller is designed to absorb the vibration caused by a large contact impact. A simulation and experiment of a 0.5-m high (foot lifting distance) vertical jump are achieved on a humanoid robot platform in this article (Fig. 1).},

	abstract = {Real-time synthesis of legged locomotion maneuvers in challenging industrial settings is still an open problem, requiring simultaneous determination of footsteps locations several steps ahead while generating whole-body motions close to the robot's limits. State estimation and perception errors impose the practical constraint of fast re-planning motions in a model predictive control (MPC) framework. We first observe that the computational limitation of perceptive locomotion pipelines lies in the combinatorics of contact surface selection. Re-planning contact locations on selected surfaces can be accomplished at MPC frequencies (50-100 Hz). Then, whole-body motion generation typically follows a reference trajectory for the robot base to facilitate convergence. We propose removing this constraint to robustly address unforeseen events such as contact slipping, by leveraging a state-of-the-art whole-body MPC (Croccodyl). Our contributions are integrated into a complete framework for perceptive locomotion, validated under diverse terrain conditions, and demonstrated in challenging trials that push the robot's actuation limits, as well as in the ICRA 2023 quadruped challenge simulation.},

However, previous works on human-robot control for legged robots are often limited to simple tasks, such as controlling movement direction, posture, or single-leg motion, yet extensive training of the operator is required. To facilitate the transfer of human intelligence to legged robots in unstructured environments, this paper presents a user-friendly closed-loop shared control framework. The main novelty is that the operator only needs to make decisions based on the recommendations of the autonomous algorithm, without having to worry about operations or consider contact planning issues. Speciﬁcally, a rough navigation path from the operator is smoothed and optimized to generate a path with reduced traversing cost. The traversability of the generated path is assessed using fast Monte Carlo tree search (FastMCTS), which is subsequently fed back through an intuitive image interface and force feedback to help the operator make decisions quickly, forming a closed-loop shared control. The simulation and hardware experiments on a hexapod robot show that the proposed framework gives full play to the advantages of human-machine collaboration, and improves the performance in terms of learning time from the operator, mission completion time, and success rate than comparison methods.},

	abstract = {Animals have evolved various agile locomotion strategies, such as sprinting, leaping, and jumping. There is a growing interest in developing legged robots that move like their biological counterparts and show various agile skills to navigate complex environments quickly. Despite the interest, the field lacks systematic benchmarks to measure the performance of control policies and hardware in agility. We introduce the Barkour benchmark, an obstacle course to quantify agility for legged robots. Inspired by dog agility competitions, it consists of diverse obstacles and a time based scoring mechanism. This encourages researchers to develop controllers that not only move fast, but do so in a controllable and versatile way. To set strong baselines, we present two methods for tackling the benchmark. In the first approach, we train specialist locomotion skills using on-policy reinforcement learning methods and combine them with a high-level navigation controller. In the second approach, we distill the specialist skills into a Transformer-based generalist locomotion policy, named Locomotion-Transformer, that can handle various terrains and adjust the robot's gait based on the perceived environment and robot states. Using a custom-built quadruped robot, we demonstrate that our method can complete the course at half the speed of a dog. We hope that our work represents a step towards creating controllers that enable robots to reach animal-level agility.},

We encode robot skills in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas that capture both safety constraints and goals for reactive tasks. Furthermore, our encoding captures the full skill execution, as opposed to prior work where only the state of the world before and after the skill is executed are considered. Our repair algorithm suggests symbolic modifications, then attempts to physically implement the suggestions by modifying the original skills subject to LTL constraints derived from the symbolic repair. If skills are not physically possible, we automatically provide additional constraints for the symbolic repair. We demonstrate our approach with a Baxter and a Clearpath Jackal.},

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising data-driven approach for automatically training such controllers. However, exploration in these high-dimensional, underactuated systems remains a significant hurdle for enabling legged robots to learn performant, naturalistic, and versatile agility skills. We propose a framework for training complex robotic skills by transferring experience from existing controllers to jumpstart learning new tasks. To leverage controllers we can acquire in practice, we design this framework to be flexible in terms of their source -- that is, the controllers may have been optimized for a different objective under different dynamics, or may require different knowledge of the surroundings -- and thus may be highly suboptimal for the target task. We show that our method enables learning complex agile jumping behaviors, navigating to goal locations while walking on hind legs, and adapting to new environments. We also demonstrate that the agile behaviors learned in this way are graceful and safe enough to deploy in the real world.},

In heterogeneous multi-agent systems, every agent is expected to complete its own tasks in service of a global team objective. However, at runtime, an agent may encounter un-modeled obstacles (e.g., doors or walls) that prevent it from achieving its own task. To address this problem, we employ the capabilities of other heterogeneous agents to resolve the obstacle. A controller framework is proposed to redirect agents with the capability of resolving the appropriate obstacles to the required target when such a situation is detected. Three case studies involving a bipedal robot Digit and a quadcopter are used to evaluate the controller performance in action. Additionally, we implement the proposed framework on a physical multi-agent robotic system to demonstrate its viability for real world applications.},

More general phases can be used to generate complex gaits, such as mixed rhythmic dancing.

However, there are still open issues in this framework, one is the lack of a unified description of intrinsic inter-limb coordination for wide range of gaits and their transitions in TO, another is motion compliance against disturbances arisen from transitions while maintaining accurate tracking performance. In this letter, we introduce the reduced antero-posterior sequence (APS) gait parametrization approach into the model predictive control (MPC) based TO. The APS gait parametrization, which is enforced as equality constraints in optimization model, enables the representation of diverse gaits, symmetrical and asymmetrical, with five parameters and offers an intuitive way to efficiently implement gait transitions with linear interpolation of gait parameters. We also construct a whole-body impedance controller that integrates the operational impedance controller into WBC, allowing to compliantly track the optimized torso state trajectories and contact forces. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified in simulations and experiments. The results indicate that the test robot is able to robustly locomote with various gaits, including diagonal walk, trot, bound, flying trot and traverse gallop at a variety of speeds, and smoothly implement gait transitions among these gaits. Compared to existing gait transition approach, ours can obtain better reference tracking performance and higher energy efficiency during gait transitions.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing a single multimodal control policy capable of generating diverse behaviors (or modes) and emergent inherent transition maneuvers for bipedal locomotion. In our method, we first learn efficient latent encodings for each behavior by training an autoencoder from a dataset of rough reference motions. These latent encodings are used as commands to train a multimodal policy through an adaptive sampling of modes and transitions to ensure consistent performance across different behaviors. We validate the policy performance in simulation for various distinct locomotion modes such as walking, leaping, jumping on a block, standing idle, and all possible combinations of inter-mode transitions. Finally, we integrate a task-based planner to rapidly generate open-loop mode plans for the trained multimodal policy to solve high-level tasks like reaching a goal position on a challenging terrain. Complex parkour-like motions by smoothly combining the discrete locomotion modes were generated in 3 min. to traverse tracks with a gap of width 0.45 m, a plateau of height 0.2 m, and a block of height 0.4 m, which are all significant compared to the dimensions of our mini-biped platform.},

	abstract = {Predeﬁned gait patterns for quadruped locomotion can hardly be optimal in all situations with regard to stability, cost of transport and velocity tracking error. Hence, in this work, we tackle the challenge of adapting a predeﬁned trotting gait, implemented in the model-based controller of Solo, to optimize both energy consumption and velocity tracking. To this end, we propose a model-free reinforcement learning method for adapting the timings of the contact/swing phases for each foot. The learned agent augments a control pipeline that was previously developed for the Solo robot. We also propose to use a self-attention mechanism over the history of states in order to extract useful information for adapting the gait. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we demonstrate how, compared to the nominal gait, our method signiﬁcantly reduces energy consumption, better tracks the desired velocity, and makes it possible to reach higher speeds.

To determine if a robot's foot is inside a contact surface, we borrow the winding number concept from topology. We then use this winding number and potential field to create a contact-surface penalty function. By using this penalty function,{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}gls\{mpc\} can select a contact surface from all candidate surfaces in the vicinity and determine footstep placements within it. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach by showing the impact of considering full-body dynamics, which includes joint torque limits and limb dynamics, on the selection of footstep placements and contact surfaces. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of deploying our topology-based approach in an{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}gls\{mpc\} scheme and explore its potential capabilities through a series of experimental and simulation trials.},

	abstract = {Locomotion has seen dramatic progress for walking or running across challenging terrains. However, robotic quadrupeds are still far behind their biological counterparts, such as dogs, which display a variety of agile skills and can use the legs beyond locomotion to perform several basic manipulation tasks like interacting with objects and climbing. In this paper, we take a step towards bridging this gap by training quadruped robots not only to walk but also to use the front legs to climb walls, press buttons, and perform object interaction in the real world. To handle this challenging optimization, we decouple the skill learning broadly into locomotion, which involves anything that involves movement whether via walking or climbing a wall, and manipulation, which involves using one leg to interact while balancing on the other three legs. These skills are trained in simulation using curriculum and transferred to the real world using our proposed sim2real variant that builds upon recent locomotion success. Finally, we combine these skills into a robust long-term plan by learning a behavior tree that encodes a high-level task hierarchy from one clean expert demonstration. We evaluate our method in both simulation and real-world showing successful executions of both short as well as long-range tasks and how robustness helps confront external perturbations.

The approach is combined with loco-manipulation MPC to track the optimal pose. Coordinating pushing reaction forces and ground reaction forces, the MPC allows accurate tracking in manipulation while maintaining stable locomotion. In numerical validation, the framework enables the humanoid robot to effectively push objects with a variety of parameter setups. The pose optimization generates different pushing poses for each setup and can be efficiently solved as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem, averaging 250 ms. The proposed control scheme enables the humanoid robot to push object with a mass of up to 20 kg (118\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the robot's mass). Additionally, the MPC can recover the system when a 120 N force disturbance is applied to the object.},

This study presents a novel leg design methodology for jumping robot using the alternating iteration approach that optimizes the leg linkage and the specified jumping motion to completely leverage the capability of the actuator. First, a coaxial parallel five-link mechanism (CPFM) classification method was proposed to extract feasible candidates of leg configuration to alleviate the intensely searching complexity due to multi-link singularity. An alternating optimization paradigm was developed by elaborately combining the motion planning (MP) and the linkage design (LD) to generate a favorable leg with a CPFM morphology. The MP task was constructed to maximize the jumping distance of the robot while the LD task was proposed to minimize the peak demand of the actuators. Finally, a sagittal jumping robot prototype was developed based on the optimal results from the proposed paradigm. We obtained a horizontal jumping performance of 1.8 times the maximum leg length, which is comparable to the natural performance of a human.},

	abstract = {Generating dynamic jumping motions on legged robots remains a challenging control problem as the full flight phase and large landing impact are expected. Compared to quadrupedal robots or other multi-legged robots, bipedal robots place higher requirements for the control strategy given a much smaller footprint. To solve this problem, a novel heuristic landing planner is proposed in this paper. With the momentum feedback during the flight phase, landing locations can be updated to minimize the influence of uncertainties from tracking errors or external disturbances when landing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to take advantage of the flight phase to reduce the impact of the jump landing which is implemented in the actual robot. By integrating it with a modified kino-dynamics motion planner with centroidal momentum and a low-level controller which explores the whole-body dynamics to hierarchically handle multiple tasks, a complete and versatile jumping control framework is designed in this paper. Extensive results of simulation and hardware jumping experiments on a miniature bipedal robot with proprioceptive actuation are provided to demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to achieve human-like efficient and robust jumping tasks, including directional jump, twisting jump, step jump, and somersaults.},

On the contrary, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown better empirical results in scenarios exhibiting non-smooth effects (contacts, frictions, etc). Our approach leverages recent works on randomized smoothing (RS) to tackle non-smoothness issues commonly encountered in optimal control, and provides key insights on the interplay between RL and OC through the prism of RS methods. This naturally leads us to introduce the randomized Differential Dynamic Programming (R-DDP) algorithm accounting for deterministic but non-smooth dynamics in a very sample-efficient way. The experiments demonstrate that our method is able to solve classic robotic problems with dry friction and frictional contacts, where classical OC algorithms are likely to fail and RL algorithms require in practice a prohibitive number of samples to find an optimal solution.},

We improved an existing state-of-the-art TAMP model integrated with the collision avoidance, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) problem. To enable the MILP solver to search for solutions efficiently, we introduced two approaches leveraging features of collision avoidance in robotic P\&P. The first approach reduces number of binary variables, which are related to the collision avoidance of delivery objects, by reformulating them as continuous variables with additional hard constraints. These hard constraints maintain consistency by conditionally propagating binary values, which are related to the carry action state and collision avoidance of robots, to the reformulated continuous variables. The second approach is more aware of the branch-and-bound method, which is the fundamental algorithm of modern MILP solvers. This approach guides the MILP solver to find integer solutions with shallower branching by adding a soft constraint, which softly restricts a robot's routes around delivery objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches with a modern MILP solver.},

LTL-based planning for hybrid systems is solved as a mixed-integer problem (MIP), especially a mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP). Due to the formulation by the MILP, we could only deal with linear systems and linear constraints. In our proposed method, we apply a convex approximation to systems that have bilinear terms and quadratic terms in their dynamics. And we incorporate nonlinear systems into existing LTL-based planning as an MILP. We demonstrate the effectiveness through numerical simulations of a simple robot arm system and drone system.},

Based on the control-inference duality, we interpret LGP in a stochastic domain as fitting a mixture of Gaussians to the posterior path distribution, where each logic pro le defines a single Gaussian path distribution.

Our method can generate motion plans with an arbitrary length in an autoregressive fashion, unlike most offline trajectory optimization algorithms for a fixed trajectory length. To this end, we first construct the motion library by solving a dense set of trajectory optimization problems for diverse scenarios and parameter settings. Then we learn the motion manifold from the dataset in a supervised learning fashion. We show that the proposed ARMP can generate physically plausible motions for various tasks and situations. We also showcase that our method can be successfully integrated with the recent robot navigation frameworks as a low-level controller and unleash the full capability of legged robots for complex indoor navigation.},

To do so, we project the whole-body dynamics of a legged robot into the nullspace of the contact constraints, allowing expression of the dynamics independent of the contact forces. Using the constrained dynamics and the centroidal momentum matrix, we are able to directly relate joint torques and centroidal states dynamics. Using the resulting model as the process model of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), we fuse the torque measurement in the centroidal state estimation problem. Through real-world experiments on a quadruped robot with different gaits, we demonstrate that the estimated centroidal states from our torque-based EKF drastically improve the recovery of these quantities compared to direct computation.},

A variant of a kinodynamic Rapidlyexploring Random Trees (RRT) planner ﬁnds a path as a parabola sequence between stance phases. To make this fast, a reachability informed control sampling scheme leverages a precomputed velocity reachability map. The path is postprocessed to eliminate redundant jumps and passed to the TO module to ﬁnd a dynamically feasible trajectory. Simulation results are presented where the proposed hybrid planner solves challenging terrains by executing multiple consecutive jumps, producing novel strategies to leap over large gaps by leveraging dynamics.

	abstract = {Locomotion of biped robots requires predictive controllers due to its unstable dynamics and physical limitations of contact forces. A real-time controller designed to perform complex motions while maintaining balance over feet must generate whole-body trajectories, predicting a few seconds in the future with a high enough updating rate to reduce model errors. Due to the huge computational power demanded by such solvers, future trajectories are usually generated using a reduced order model that contains the unstable dynamics. However, this simplification introduces feasibility problems on many edge cases. Considering the permanent improvement of computers and algorithms, whole-body locomotion in real-time is becoming a viable option for humanoids, and this article aims at illustrating this point. We propose a whole-body model predictive control scheme based on differential dynamic programming that takes into account the full dynamics of the system and decides the optimal actuation for the robot's lower body (20 degrees of freedom) along a preview horizon of 1.5 s. Our experimental validation on the torque-controlled robot Talos shows good and promising results for dynamic locomotion at different gaits as well as 10 cm height stairstep crossing.},

	abstract = {In Receding Horizon Planning (RHP), it is critical that the motion being executed facilitates the completion of the task, e.g. building momentum to overcome large obstacles. This requires a value function to inform the desirability of robot states. However, given the complex dynamics, value functions are often approximated by expensive computation of trajectories in an extended planning horizon. In this work, to achieve online multi-contact Receding Horizon Planning (RHP), we propose to learn an oracle that can predict local objectives (intermediate goals) for a given task based on the current robot state and the environment. Then, we use these local objectives to construct local value functions to guide a short-horizon RHP. To obtain the oracle, we take a supervised learning approach, and we present an incremental training scheme that can improve the prediction accuracy by adding demonstrations on how to recover from failures. We compare our approach against the baseline (long-horizon RHP) for planning centroidal trajectories of humanoid walking on moderate slopes as well as large slopes where static stability cannot be achieved. We validate these trajectories by tracking them via a whole-body inverse dynamics controller in simulation. We show that our approach can achieve online RHP for 95\%-98.6\% cycles, outperforming the baseline (8\%-51.2\%).},

This paper presents a complete method to plan and control the locomotion of quadruped robots when 3D information about the surrounding obstacles is available, based on several stages of decision. We first propose a contact planner formulated as a mixed-integer program, optimized on-line at each new robot step. It selects a surface from a set of convex surfaces describing the environment for the next footsteps while ensuring kinematic constraints. We then propose to optimize the exact contact location and the feet trajectories at control frequency to avoid obstacles, thanks to an efficient formulation of quadratic programs optimizing Bezier curves. By relying on the locomotion controller of our quadruped robot Solo, we finally implement the complete method, provided as an open-source package. Its efficiency is asserted by statistical evaluation of the importance of each component in simulation. We have a 100\% success rate for our framework, and we show that the deactivation of the contact planning, footstep adaptation and collision avoidance, respectively induced a drop to 70\%, 62\% and 83\% success rate in the worst case, justifying the complete architecture.},

Hereby, our approach addresses the challenge of online terrain perception and soft real-time footstep planning. The proposed new formulation of the search-based planning problem makes no specific assumptions about the robot kinematics (e.g. number of legs) or the used locomotion control schemes. Therefore, it can be applied to a broad range of different types of legged robots. Unlike current methods, the proposed new framework can optionally consider the floating base as part of the state-space. It is possible to configure the complexity of the planner online, from efficiently solving tasks in flat terrain to using non-contiguous contacts in highly challenging terrain.

Often, obstacles create local minima in the search space, forcing heuristic planners such as A* to expand large areas. Furthermore, planning longer footstep paths often takes a long time to compute. In this work, we introduce and discuss several solutions to these problems. For navigation, ﬁnding the optimal path initially is often not needed as it can be improved while walking. Thus, anytime search-based planning based on the anytime repairing A* or randomized A* search provides promising functionality. It allows to obtain efﬁcient paths with provable suboptimality within short planning times. Opposed to completely randomized methods, anytime searchbased planners generate paths that are goal-directed and guaranteed to be no more than a certain factor longer than the optimal solution. By adding new stepping capabilities and accounting for the whole body of the robot in the collision check, we extend the footstep planning approach to 3D. This enables a humanoid to step over clutter and climb onto obstacles. We thoroughly evaluated the performance of search-based planning in cluttered environments and for longer paths. We furthermore provide solutions to efﬁciently plan long trajectories using an adaptive level-of-detail planning approach.},

	abstract = {We consider a class of mixed integer programs where the problem is convex except for a vector of discrete variables. Two methods based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) are presented. The ﬁrst, which has appeared in the recent literature, duplicates the discrete variable, with one copy allowed to vary continuously. This results in a simple projection, or rounding, to determine the discrete variable at each iteration. We introduce an alternate method, whereby part of the objective is replaced by a new variable instead. When the objective satisﬁes a certain condition, this allows the update of the discrete variables to be handled separately for each one, thus maintaining linear complexity of this update, while incorporating some of the objective into the update. Initial comparisons on examples for which both methods are applicable show that the latter exhibits clear improvements in both performance and runtime.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a locomotion generation method for quadruped robots, which first computes an optimal trajectory of the robot’s center of mass (CoM) and then its whole-body motion through inverse kinematics. As the core component, the computing of the CoM trajectory, which is parameterized as polynomials, is based on the robot’s centroidal dynamics and it is observed that several terms in the centroidal dynamics are minor and can be omitted in the locomotion generation. Then, as a basic form of the proposed method, the CoM trajectory optimization is written as a quadratic programming (QP) problem for the case of given step sequences, timings and footholds. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the robot’s CoM, which is described as a convex polyhedron around a nominal CoM position, and the reachability of the robot’s feet, which is approximated as another convex polyhedron, can be added to the QP problem as linear inequality constraints. Ultimately, the planning of step sequences, timings, and footholds is all incorporated, leading to a single mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. Numerical and hardware experiments have been conducted and show that the proposed method can generate various walking motions for a quadruped robot to travel over challenging terrains.},

We present an efficient motion planning framework for simultaneously solving locomotion (e.g., centroidal dynamics), grasping (e.g., patch contact), and contact (e.g., gait) problems. To accelerate the planning process, we propose distributed optimization frameworks based on Alternating Direction Methods of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the original large-scale Mixed-Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP). The resulting frameworks use Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) to solve contact and NonLinear Programming (NLP) to solve nonlinear dynamics, which are more computationally tractable and less sensitive to parameters. Also, we explicitly enforce patch contact constraints from limit surfaces with micro-spine grippers. We demonstrate our proposed framework in the hardware experiments, showing that the multi-limbed robot is able to realize various motions including free-climbing at a slope angle 45° with a much shorter planning time.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) based controllers for legged robots have demonstrated impressive ro-bustness for walking in different environments for several robot platforms. To enable the application of RL policies for humanoid robots in real-world settings, it is crucial to build a system that can achieve robust walking in any direction, on 2D and 3D terrains, and be controllable by a user-command. In this paper, we tackle this problem by learning a policy to follow a given step sequence. The policy is trained with the help of a set of procedurally generated step sequences (also called footstep plans). We show that simply feeding the upcoming 2 steps to the policy is sufficient to achieve omnidirectional walking, turning in place, standing, and climbing stairs. Our method employs curriculum learning on the complexity of terrains, and circumvents the need for reference motions or pre-trained weights. We demonstrate the application of our proposed method to learn RL policies for 2 new robot platforms - HRP5P and JVRC-1 - in the MuJoCo simulation environment. The code for training and evaluation is available online.††https://github.com/rohanpsingh/LearningHumanoidWalking.},

	doi = {10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2012.6651592},
	abstract = {Efficient footstep planning for humanoid navigation through cluttered environments is still a challenging problem. Many obstacles create local minima in the search space, forcing heuristic planners such as A* to expand large areas. The goal of this work is to efficiently compute long, feasible footstep paths. For navigation, finding the optimal path initially is often not needed as it can be improved while walking. Thus, we propose anytime search-based planning using the anytime repairing A* (ARA*) and randomized A* (R*) planners. This allows to obtain efficient paths with provable suboptimality within short planning times. Opposed to completely randomized methods such as rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs), these planners create paths that are goal-directed and guaranteed to be no more than a certain factor longer than the optimal solution. We thoroughly evaluated the planners in various scenarios using different heuristics. ARA* with the 2D Dijkstra heuristic yields fast and efficient solutions but its potential inadmissibility results in non-optimal paths for some scenarios. R*, on the other hand borrows ideas from RRTs, yields fast solutions, and is less dependent on a well-designed heuristic function. This allows it to avoid local minima and reduces the number of expanded states.},

This way we exploit the active compliance of our system to smoothly interact with the environment, even when this is inaccurately perceived or dynamically changing, and update the planned path on-the-fly. In tandem we use a virtual model controller that provides the feed-forward torques that allow increased accuracy together with highly compliant behaviour on an otherwise naturally very stiff robotic system. We leverage the full set of benefits that a high performance torque controlled quadruped robot can provide and demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of our approach on a set of experimental trials of increasing difficulty.},

	abstract = {Vision is one of the essential perception modalities for legged robots to safely and efﬁciently navigate uneven terrains, such as stairs and stepping stones. However, training robots to effectively understand high-dimensional visual input for locomotion is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a framework to train a vision-based locomotion controller which enables a quadrupedal robot to traverse uneven environments. The key idea is to introduce a hierarchical structure with a high-level vision policy and a low-level motion controller. The high-level vision policy takes as inputs the perceived vision signals as well as robot states and outputs the desired footholds and base movement of the robot. These are then realized by the low level motion controller composed of a position controller for swing legs and a MPC-based torque controller for stance legs. We train the vision policy using Deep Reinforcement Learning and demonstrate our approach on a variety of uneven environments such as randomly placed stepping stones, quincuncial piles, stairs, and moving platforms. We also validate our method on a real robot to walk over a series of gaps and climbing up a platform.},

We introduce a mobility-based criterion to define an NMPC cost that enhances the locomotion of quadruped robots while maximizing leg mobility and improves adaptation to the terrain features. Our NMPC is based on the real-time iteration scheme that allows us to re-plan online at 25 Hz with a prediction horizon of 2 seconds. We use the single rigid body dynamic model defined in the center of mass frame in order to increase the computational efficiency. In simulations, the NMPC is tested to traverse a set of pallets of different sizes, to walk into a V-shaped chimney, and to locomote over rough terrain. In real experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our NMPC with the mobility feature that allowed IIT’s 87 kg quadruped robot HyQ to achieve an omni-directional walk on flat terrain, to traverse a static pallet, and to adapt to a repositioned pallet during a walk.},

	title = {Mixed-{Integer} {Convex} {Optimization} for {Planning} {Aggressive} {Motions} of {Legged} {Robots} {Over} {Rough} {Terrain}},
	abstract = {Planning dynamic motions for a legged robot entails addressing both the continuous question of how its joints should move and the combinatorial question of which hand or foot should touch which surface and in what order. Fortunately, these two questions are linked by the centroidal dynamics of the robot, which we can express either in terms of its joint angle trajectories or in terms of its foot placements and applied forces. Based on this insight, I formulate a pair of mathematical programs for planning highly dynamic motions for legged robots. The first is a mixed-integer convex program, specifically, a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP), that yields a sequence of footholds/handholds as well as center of mass (COM) and angular momentum trajectories. The second is a trajectory optimization, formulated as a nonlinear program (NLP), that returns trajectories for the COM, angular momentum, and joint angles subject to the footholds/handholds chosen by the MIQP step. While any number of trajectory optimization schemes could be used here, we present one which is particularly useful in this case, as it enforces the system’s dynamics directly in terms of its COM motion and angular momentum. As a result, the solution to the MIQP provides constraints (where each end-effector is required to make contact with the environment) for the NLP and also gives seeds for the decision variables corresponding to the robot’s centroidal motion. Thus, the three primary contributions of this thesis are: an MIQP-based approach to gait selection over irregular terrain, a trajectory optimization formulation for floating-base systems subject to external forces and kinematic constraints, and a planning methodology that integrates both of those to generate highly dynamic motions in challenging environments. I apply these techniques to models of a quadruped and a humanoid (Boston Dynamics’ LittleDog and Atlas respectively) to generate motion plans for running, jumping, and other dynamic behaviors.},

	abstract = {Online footstep planning is essential for bipedal walking robots, allowing them to walk in the presence of disturbances and sensory noise. Most of the literature on the topic has focused on optimizing the footstep placement while keeping the step timing constant. In this work, we introduce a footstep planner capable of optimizing footstep placement and step time online. The proposed planner, consisting of an Interior Point Optimizer (IPOPT) and an optimizer based on Augmented Lagrangian (AL) method with analytical gradient descent, solves the full dynamics of the Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model in real time to optimize for footstep location as well as step timing at the rate of 200{\textasciitilde}Hz. We show that such asynchronous real-time optimization with the AL method (ARTO-AL) provides the required robustness and speed for successful online footstep planning. Furthermore, ARTO-AL can be extended to plan footsteps in 3D, allowing terrain-aware footstep planning on uneven terrains. Compared to an algorithm with no footstep time adaptation, our proposed ARTO-AL demonstrates increased stability in simulated walking experiments as it can resist pushes on flat ground and on a \$10{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ ramp up to 120 N and 100 N respectively.

The algorithm alternates between two convex optimizations: (1) a quadratic program that generates a set of hyperplanes to separate a convex region of space from the set of obstacles and (2) a semideﬁnite program that ﬁnds a maximum-volume ellipsoid inside the polytope intersection of the obstacle-free half-spaces deﬁned by those hyperplanes. Both the hyperplanes and the ellipsoid are reﬁned over several iterations to monotonically increase the volume of the inscribed ellipsoid, resulting in a large polytope and ellipsoid of obstacle-free space. Practical applications of the algorithm are presented in 2D and 3D, and extensions to N -dimensional conﬁguration spaces are discussed. Experiments demonstrate that the algorithm has a computation time which is linear in the number of obstacles, and our matlab [18] implementation converges in seconds for environments with millions of obstacles.},

This problem is of great importance for terrain mapping in complicated environment and has great potentials in legged locomotion applications. To address the polytopic planar region characterization problem, we propose a two-stage solution scheme. At the first stage, the planar regions embedded within a sequence of depth images are extracted individually first and then merged to establish a terrain map containing only planar regions in a selected frame. To simplify the representations of the planar regions that are applicable to foothold planning for legged robots, we further approximate the extracted planar regions via low-dimensional polytopes at the second stage. With the polytopic representation, the proposed approach achieves a great balance between accuracy and simplicity. Experimental validations with RGB-D cameras are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme successfully characterizes the planar regions via polytopes with acceptable accuracy. More importantly, the run time of the overall perception scheme is less than 10ms (i.e., {\textgreater} 100Hz) throughout the tests, which strongly illustrates the advantages of our approach developed in this paper.},

Due to the equivalence, results from the first class transfer to the DCSs. Therefore, to get the right numerical sensitivities one has to have a step-size of h = o(σ), where σ is the relaxation or smoothing parameter in the MPCC.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02127},
	abstract = {Implementing dynamic locomotion behaviors on legged robots requires a high-quality state estimation module. Especially when the motion includes flight phases, state-of-the-art approaches fail to produce reliable estimation of the robot posture, in particular base height. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for combining visual-inertial odometry (VIO) with leg odometry in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based state estimator. The VIO module uses a stereo camera and IMU to yield low-drift 3D position and yaw orientation and drift-free pitch and roll orientation of the robot base link in the inertial frame. However, these values have a considerable amount of latency due to image processing and optimization, while the rate of update is quite low which is not suitable for low-level control. To reduce the latency, we predict the VIO state estimate at the rate of the IMU measurements of the VIO sensor. The EKF module uses the base pose and linear velocity predicted by VIO, fuses them further with a second high-rate IMU and leg odometry measurements, and produces robot state estimates with a high frequency and small latency suitable for control. We integrate this lightweight estimation framework with a nonlinear model predictive controller and show successful implementation of a set of agile locomotion behaviors, including trotting and jumping at varying horizontal speeds, on a torque-controlled quadruped robot.},

Unfortunately many researchers and engineers struggle with the formulation of such problems and often fall back to suboptimal solutions.

This document discusses an alternative approach which makes use of a more abstract notion of 3D orientations. The relative orientation between two coordinate systems is primarily identiﬁed by the coordinate mapping it induces.

While promising results have been recently achieved, robust and reliable controllers are still a challenge for the control community dealing with humanoid robotics. Momentum-based strategies have proven their effectiveness for controlling humanoids balancing, but the stability analysis of these controllers is still missing. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we numerically show that the application of state-of-the-art momentum-based control strategies may lead to unstable zero dynamics. Secondly, we propose simple modifications to the control architecture that avoid instabilities at the zero-dynamics level. Asymptotic stability of the closed loop system is shown by means of a Lyapunov analysis on the linearized system's joint space. The theoretical results are validated with both simulations and experiments on the iCub humanoid robot.},

We regulate the forces between the robot and its surrounding environment to stabilize a desired posture. We assume that the forces and torques are exerted on rigid contacts. The validity of this assumption is guaranteed by constraining the contact forces and torques, e.g., the contact forces must belong to the associated friction cones. The implementation of this control strategy requires the estimation of both joint torques and external forces acting on the robot. We then detail algorithms to obtain these estimates when using a robot with an iCub-like sensor set, i.e., distributed six-axis force-torque sensors and whole-body tactile sensors. A general theory for identifying the robot inertial parameters is also presented. From an actuation standpoint, we show how to implement a joint-torque control in the case of DC brushless motors. In addition, the coupling mechanism of the iCub torso is investigated. The soundness of the entire control architecture is validated in a real scenario involving the robot iCub balancing and making contact with both arms.},

In this work, we introduce a few variations of the well-established augmented Lagrangian method, specifically for solving QPs, which include heuristics for improving practical numerical performances. Those variants are embedded within an open-source software which includes an efficient C++ implementation, a modular API, as well as best-performing heuristics for our test-bed. Relying on this framework, we present a benchmark studying the practical performances of modern optimization solvers for convex QPs on generic and complex problems of the literature as well as on common robotic scenarios. This benchmark notably highlights that this approach outperforms modern solvers in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness for small to medium-sized problems, while remaining competitive for higher dimensions.},

Starting from a steady-state running motion, a new spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) based 3D template model for a running jump is presented. The use of this model is motivated by a simpler model from biomechanics which describes the dynamics of human long jumpers in the sagittal plane. While previously only used to describe the thrust step of a long jump, this type of model is also shown to generate useful Center of Mass (CoM) trajectories to return to steady-state running upon landing. A principled optimization approach for this new template is described to generate reference CoM trajectories for maximum span which are able to be kinematically and dynamically retargeted to the humanoid. The key features of an optimal long jump are highlighted, and a task-space control approach to realize the motion on a humanoid is summarized. A video attachment to this paper shows an optimal long jump for a 6 m/s approach speed, where the humanoid is able to clear a large gap, and highlights the effects of non-optimal takeoff-velocity angles.},

In this paper, we study these reference points for normal human walking, and discuss their applicability in legged machine control. Since the FRI was proposed as an indicator of foot rotation, we hypothesize that the FRI will closely track the ZMP in early single support when the foot remains flat on the ground, but will then significantly diverge from the ZMP in late single support as the foot rolls during heel-off. Additionally, since spin angular momentum has been shown to remain small throughout the walking cycle, we hypothesize that the CMP will never leave the ground support base throughout the entire gait cycle, closely tracking the ZMP. We test these hypotheses using a morphologically realistic human model and kinetic and kinematic gait data measured from ten human subjects walking at self-selected speeds. We find that the mean separation distance between the FRI and ZMP during heel-off is within the accuracy of their measurement (0.1\% of foot length). Thus, the FRI point is determined not to be an adequate measure of foot rotational acceleration and a modified FRI point is proposed. Finally, we find that the CMP never leaves the ground support base, and the mean separation distance between the CMP and ZMP is small (14\% of foot length), highlighting how closely the human body regulates spin angular momentum in level ground walking.},

Of increasing interest is the autonomy for dynamic robots, such as multirotors, motor vehicles, and legged platforms. Here, disturbances and environmental conditions can have significant impact on the successful performance of the individual dynamic behaviors, referred to as "motion primitives". Despite this, robustness can be achieved by switching to and transitioning through suitable motion primitives. This paper contributes such a method by presenting an abstraction of the motion primitive dynamics and a corresponding "motion primitive transfer function". From this, a mixed discrete and continuous "motion primitive graph" is constructed, and an algorithm capable of online search of this graph is detailed. The result is a framework capable of realizing holistic robustness on dynamic systems. This is experimentally demonstrated for a set of motion primitives on a quadrupedal robot, subject to various environmental and intentional disturbances.},

We utilize an efficient solution algorithm for the MPC problem that optimizes the switching times and trajectory simultaneously. The present efficient algorithm, unlike inefficient existing methods, enables online optimization as well as switching times. The proposed MPC with online STO is compared over the conventional MPC with fixed switching times, through numerical simulations of dynamic jumping motions of a quadruped robot. In the simulation comparison, the proposed MPC successfully controls the dynamic jumping motions in twice as many cases as the conventional MPC, which indicates that the proposed method extends the ability of the whole-body MPC. We further conduct hardware experiments on the quadrupedal robot Unitree A1 and prove that the proposed method achieves dynamic motions on the real robot.},

	abstract = {Control of robots with kinematic constraints like loop-closure constraints or interactions with the environment requires solving the underlying constrained dynamics equations of motion. Several approaches have been proposed so far in the literature to solve these constrained optimization problems, for instance by either taking advantage in part of the sparsity of the kinematic tree or by considering an explicit formulation of the constraints in the problem resolution. Yet, not all the constraints allow an explicit formulation and in general, approaches of the state of the art suffer from singularity issues, especially in the context of redundant or singular constraints. In this paper, we propose a uniﬁed approach to solve forward dynamics equations involving constraints in an efﬁcient, generic and robust manner. To this aim, we ﬁrst (i) propose a proximal formulation of the constrained dynamics which converges to an optimal solution in the least-square sense even in the presence of singularities. Based on this proximal formulation, we introduce (ii) a sparse Cholesky factorization of the underlying Karush–Kuhn–Tucker matrix related to the constrained dynamics, which exploits at best the sparsity of the kinematic structure of the robot. We also show (iii) that it is possible to extract from this factorization the Cholesky decomposition associated to the so-called Operational Space Inertia Matrix, inherent to task-based control frameworks or physic simulations. These new formulation and factorization, implemented within the Pinocchio library, are benchmark on various robotic platforms, ranging from classic robotic arms or quadrupeds to humanoid robots with closed kinematic chains, and show how they signiﬁcantly outperform alternative solutions of the state of the art by a factor 2 or more.},

The imitation of reference motions provides a simple and powerful prior for guiding solutions towards desired solutions without the need for meticulous reward design. While much work uses motion capture data or hand-crafted trajectories as the reference motion, relatively little work has explored the use of reference motions coming from model-based trajectory optimization. In this work, we investigate several design considerations that arise with such a framework, as demonstrated through four dynamic behaviours: trot, front hop, 180 backflip, and biped stepping. These are trained in simulation and transferred to a physical Solo 8 quadruped robot without further adaptation. In particular, we explore the space of feed-forward designs afforded by the trajectory optimizer to understand its impact on RL learning efficiency and sim-to-real transfer. These findings contribute to the long standing goal of producing robot controllers that combine the interpretability and precision of model-based optimization with the robustness that model-free RL-based controllers offer.},

Locomotion is formulated as multiple tasks (e.g. maintaining balance or tracking a desired motion of one of the limbs) which are solved in a prioritized way using QP solvers. It is shown how complex locomotion behaviors can purely emerge from robot-specific inequality tasks (i.e. torque or reaching limits) together with the optimization of balance and system manipulability. Without any specific motion planning, this prioritized task optimization leads to a natural adaption of the robot to the terrain while walking and hence enables blind locomotion over rough grounds. The presented framework is implemented and successfully tested on ANYmal, a torque controllable quadrupedal robot. It enables the machine to walk while accounting for slippage and torque limitation constraints, and even step down from an unperceived 14 cm obstacle. Thereby, ANYmal exploits the maximum reach of the limbs and automatically adapts the body posture and height.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of legged systems are characterized by under-actuation, instability, and contact state switching. We present a trajectory optimization method for generating physically consistent motions under these conditions. By integrating a custom solver for hard contact forces in the system dynamics model, the optimal control algorithm has the authority to freely transition between open, closed, and sliding contact states along the trajectory. Our method can discover stepping motions without a predefined contact schedule. Moreover, the optimizer makes use of slipping contacts if a no-slip condition is too restrictive for the task at hand. Additionally, we show that new behaviors like skating over slippery surfaces emerge automatically, which would not be possible with classical methods that assume stationary contact points. Experiments in simulation and on hardware confirm the physical consistency of the generated trajectories. Our solver achieves iteration rates of 40 Hz for a 1 s horizon and is therefore fast enough to run in a receding horizon setting.},

The VSCM facilitates the convergence of gradient-based optimization without compromising physical fidelity. On the other hand, the proposed SCvx-based approach combines the advantages of direct and shooting methods for CITO. For evaluations, we consider non-prehensile manipulation tasks. The proposed method is compared to a version based on iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) on a planar example. The results demonstrate that both methods can find physically-consistent motions that complete the tasks without a meaningful initial guess owing to the VSCM. The proposed SCvx-based method outperforms the iLQR-based method in terms of convergence, computation time, and the quality of motions found. Finally, the proposed SCvx-based method is tested on a standard robot platform and shown to perform efficiently for a real-world application.},

We challenge this intuitive notion by demonstrating robust and dynamic locomotion with a learned motion controller executing at as low as 8 Hz on a real ANYmal C quadruped. The robot is able to robustly and repeatably achieve a high heading velocity of 1.5 m s−1, traverse uneven terrain, and resist unexpected external perturbations. We further present a comparative analysis of deep reinforcement learning (RL) based motion control policies trained and executed at frequencies ranging from 5 Hz to 200 Hz. We show that low-frequency policies are less sensitive to actuation latencies and variations in system dynamics. This is to the extent that a successful sim-to-real transfer can be performed even without any dynamics randomization or actuation modeling. We support this claim through a set of rigorous empirical evaluations.

	abstract = {Direct collocation methods are powerful tools to solve trajectory optimization problems in robotics. While their resulting trajectories tend to be dynamically accurate, they may also present large kinematic errors in the case of constrained mechanical systems, i.e., those whose state coordinates are subject to holonomic or nonholonomic constraints, such as loop-closure or rolling-contact constraints. These constraints confine the robot trajectories to an implicitly-defined manifold, which complicates the computation of accurate solutions. Discretization errors inherent to the transcription of the problem easily make the trajectories drift away from this manifold, which results in physically inconsistent motions that are difficult to track with a controller. This article reviews existing methods to deal with this problem and proposes new ones to overcome their limitations. Current approaches either disregard the kinematic constraints (which leads to drift accumulation) or modify the system dynamics to keep the trajectory close to the manifold (which adds artificial forces or energy dissipation to the system). The methods we propose, in contrast, achieve full drift elimination on the discrete trajectory, or even along the continuous one, without artificial modifications of the system dynamics. We illustrate and compare the methods using various examples of different complexity.},

However, most learning-based frameworks for controller development focus on training robot-specific controllers, a process that needs to be repeated for every new robot. In this work, we introduce a framework for training generalized locomotion (GenLoco) controllers for quadrupedal robots. Our framework synthesizes general-purpose locomotion controllers that can be deployed on a large variety of quadrupedal robots with similar morphologies. We present a simple but effective morphology randomization method that procedurally generates a diverse set of simulated robots for training. We show that by training a controller on this large set of simulated robots, our models acquire more general control strategies that can be directly transferred to novel simulated and real-world robots with diverse morphologies, which were not observed during training.},

Existing MPC implementations often handle computational complexity by shortening prediction horizons or simplifying models, both of which can result in instability. Inspired by related approaches in behavioral economics, motion planning, and biomechanics, our method solves MPC problems with a simple model for dynamics and constraints over regions of the horizon where such a model is feasible and a complex model where it is not. The approach leverages an interleaving of planning and execution to iteratively identify these regions, which can be safely simplified if they satisfy an exact template/anchor relationship. We show that this method does not compromise the stability and feasibility properties of the system, and measure performance in simulation experiments on a quadrupedal robot executing agile behaviors over terrains of interest. We find that this adaptive method enables more agile motion and expands the range of executable tasks compared to fixed-complexity implementations.},

Previous attempts at addressing such a problem were performed offline and do not consider avoiding obstacles online. In this letter, we introduce a cascaded planning scheme with a parallelized centralized trajectory optimization that deals with hybrid mode switches. We additionally develop a set of decentralized planners per robot, which enables our approach to solve the problem of collaborative load manipulation online.

However, without proper synchronization, the correctness of the combined behavior is hard to guarantee, such as to follow a specific ordering of sub-tasks or to perform a simultaneous collaboration. This work addresses the minimum-time task planning problem for multi-agent systems under complex global tasks stated as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. These tasks include the temporal and spatial requirements on both independent local actions and direct sub-team collaborations. The proposed solution is an anytime algorithm that combines the partial-ordering analysis of the underlying task automaton for task decomposition, and the branch and bound (BnB) search method for task assignment. Analyses of its soundness, completeness and optimality as the minimal completion time are provided. It is also shown that a feasible and near-optimal solution is quickly reached while the search continues within the time budget. Furthermore, to handle fluctuations in task duration and agent failures during online execution, an adaptation algorithm is proposed to synchronize execution status and re-assign unfinished subtasks dynamically to maintain correctness and optimality. Both algorithms are validated rigorously over large-scale systems via numerical simulations and hardware experiments, against several strong baselines.},

Due to the novel attitude planning method, the horizontal motion plans can be applied to various terrain conditions. The attitude planner ensures the robot stability by imposing limits to the angular acceleration. Our whole-body controller tracks compliantly trunk motions while avoiding slippage, as well as kinematic and torque limits. Despite the use of a simplified model, which is restricted to flat terrain, our approach shows remarkable capability to deal with a wide range of non-coplanar terrains. The results are validated by experimental trials and comparative evaluations in a series of terrains of progressively increasing complexity.},

The developed controller enables high-speed running of up to 6 m/s (Froude number of Fr ≈ 7.34) incorporating proprioceptive feedback and programmable virtual leg compliance of the MIT Cheetah. To achieve a stable and fast trot gait, we applied three control strategies: (a) programmable virtual leg compliance that provides instantaneous reflexes to external disturbance and facilitates the self-stabilizing shown in the passive dynamics of locomotion; (b) tunable stance-trajectory design, intended to adjust impulse at each foot-end in the stance phase in a high speed trot-running according to the equilibrium-point hypothesis; and (c) a gait-pattern modulation that imposes a desired cyclic gait-pattern taking cues from proprioceptive TD feedback. Based on three strategies, the controller is hierarchically structured. The control parameters for forward speeds, a specific gait-pattern, and desired leg trajectories are managed by a high-level controller. It consists of both a gait-pattern modulator with proprioceptive leg TD detection and a leg-trajectory generator using a Bèzier curve and a tunable amplitude sinusoidal wave. Instead of employing physical spring/dampers in the robot’s leg, the programmable virtual leg compliance is realized using proprioceptive impedance control in individual low-level leg controllers. 
To verify the developed controller, a robot dynamic simulator is constructed based on the model parameters of the MIT Cheetah. The controller parameters are tuned with the simulator to achieve self-stability, and then applied to the MIT Cheetah in an experimental environment. Using leg kinematics and applied motor current feedbacks, the MIT Cheetah achieved a stable trot-running gait in the sagittal plane.},

Using this strategy, we are able to learn the cost and dynamics of a controller via end-to-end learning. Our experiments focus on imitation learning in the pendulum and cartpole domains, where we learn the cost and dynamics terms of an MPC policy class.

These results were obtained through offline non-linear optimization over the full-body model. However, in real life, the conditions under which the optimization was solved are not always perfectly matched, e.g., the initial conditions may vary, the environment may change, etc. We can parameterize those variables in order to obtain approximations of the solutions of the offline optimization when the parameter of interest changes. In this paper, we use numeric sensitivities to obtain those approximations for a specific task (back-flipping and ending on a table, where the height of the table is a parameter) and we use the centroidal dynamics as the model for the offline optimization.

	abstract = {In Receding Horizon Planning (RHP), it is critical that the motion being executed facilitates the completion of the task, e.g. building momentum to overcome large obstacles. This requires a value function to inform the desirability of robot states. However, given the complex dynamics, value functions are often approximated by expensive computation of trajectories in an extended planning horizon. In this work, to achieve online multi-contact Receding Horizon Planning (RHP), we propose to learn an oracle that can predict local objectives (intermediate goals) for a given task based on the current robot state and the environment. Then, we use these local objectives to construct local value functions to guide a short-horizon RHP. To obtain the oracle, we take a supervised learning approach, and we present an incremental training scheme that can improve the prediction accuracy by adding demonstrations on how to recover from failures. We compare our approach against the baseline (long-horizon RHP) for planning centroidal trajectories of humanoid walking on moderate slopes as well as large slopes where static stability cannot be achieved. We validate these trajectories by tracking them via a whole-body inverse dynamics controller in simulation. We show that our approach can achieve online RHP for 95\%-98.6\% cycles, outperforming the baseline (8\%-51.2\%).},

When for example, a legged robot has to react to disturbances from the environment (e.g., recover after a push) or track a certain goal with statically unstable gaits, the effectiveness of the algorithm can degrade. In this work we propose a novel optimization-based Reference Generator, named Governor, which exploits a Linear Inverted Pendulum model to compute reference trajectories for the Center of Mass, while taking into account the possible under-actuation of a gait (e.g. in a trot). The obtained trajectories are used as references for the cost function of the Nonlinear MPC presented in our previous work [1]. We also present a formulation that can guarantee a certain response time to reach a goal, without the need to tune the weights of the cost terms. In addition, foothold locations are corrected to drive the robot towards the goal.

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) based controllers for legged robots have demonstrated impressive robustness for walking in different environments for several robot platforms. To enable the application of RL policies for humanoid robots in real-world settings, it is crucial to build a system that can achieve robust walking in any direction, on 2D and 3D terrains, and be controllable by a user-command. In this paper, we tackle this problem by learning a policy to follow a given step sequence. The policy is trained with the help of a set of procedurally generated step sequences (also called footstep plans). We show that simply feeding the upcoming 2 steps to the policy is sufficient to achieve omnidirectional walking, turning in place, standing, and climbing stairs. Our method employs curriculum learning on the complexity of terrains, and circumvents the need for reference motions or pre-trained weights. We demonstrate the application of our proposed method to learn RL policies for 2 new robot platforms - HRP5P and JVRC-1 - in the MuJoCo simulation environment.

	abstract = {This paper presents an optimal motion planning framework to generate versatile energy-optimal quadrupedal jumping motions automatically (e.g., flips, spin). The jumping motions via the centroidal dynamics are formulated as a 12-dimensional black-box optimization problem subject to the robot kino-dynamic constraints. Gradient-based approaches offer great success in addressing trajectory optimization (TO), yet, prior knowledge (e.g., reference motion, contact schedule) is required and results in sub-optimal solutions. The new proposed framework first employed a heuristics-based optimization method to avoid these problems. Moreover, a prioritization fitness function is created for heuristics-based algorithms in robot ground reaction force (GRF) planning, enhancing convergence and searching performance considerably. Since heuristics-based algorithms often require significant time, motions are planned offline and stored as a pre-motion library. A selector is designed to automatically choose motions with user-specified or perception information as input. The proposed framework has been successfully validated only with a simple continuously tracking PD controller in an open-source Mini-Cheetah by several challenging jumping motions, including jumping over a window-shaped obstacle with 30 cm height and left-flipping over a rectangle obstacle with 27 cm height.},

Introducing multi-heterogeneous robot systems (MHRS) and sensor networks into a smart home is a promising approach to improve the safety and acceptability of elderly care services in daily life. Among them, the energy consumption and task planning of MHRS determine nursing safety, which is particularly important in the real nursing process. Therefore, we established a novel smart home for elderly care based on seven heterogeneous nursing robots, and proposed a multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) algorithm, considering execution time and energy consumption. The whole system efficiency makes up for the functional limitations and service continuity of traditional MHRS. To realize efficiently conducted multitasks, we established an architecture with centralized task allocation center, robot alliance layer and distributed execution layer for the MHRS. The self-organizing architecture contributes to overall task allocation, communication and adaptive cooperative control between different robots. Then, to clearly describe the continuous nursing process with multiple simultaneous demands and emergency tasks, we modeled the whole nursing process with continuity, multi-priority, and interpretability. A novel MRTA algorithm with a dynamic bidding mechanism was proposed. Comprehensive experiments showed that the proposed algorithm could effectively solve the three key problems of multi-priority tasks, multi-robot safe and adaptive cooperation, and emergency task call in the scene of elderly care. The proposed architecture regarding the smart home could be applied in nursing centers, hospitals, and other places for elderly care.},

	abstract = {The complex dynamics characterizing deformable terrain presents significant impediments toward the real-world viability of locomotive robotics, particularly for legged machines. We explore vertical, robotic jumping as a model task for legged locomotion on presumed-uncharacterized, nonrigid terrain. By integrating Gaussian process (GP)-based regression and evaluation to estimate ground reaction forces as a function of the state, a 1-D jumper acquires the capability to learn forcing profiles exerted by its environment in tandem with achieving its control objective. The GP-based dynamical model initially assumes a baseline rigid, noncompliant surface. As part of an iterative procedure, the optimizer employing this model generates an optimal control strategy to achieve a target jump height. Experiential data recovered from execution on the true surface model are applied to train the GP, in turn, providing the optimizer a more richly informed dynamical model of the environment. The iterative control-learning procedure was rigorously evaluated in experiment, over different surface types, whereby a robotic hopper was challenged to jump to several different target heights. Each task was achieved within ten attempts, over which the terrain's dynamics were learned. With each iteration, GP predictions of ground forcing became incrementally refined, rapidly matching experimental force measurements. The few-iteration convergence demonstrates a fundamental capacity to both estimate and adapt to unknown terrain dynamics in application-realistic time scales, all with control tools amenable to robotic legged locomotion.},

The interaction between the robot and the walking surface is modeled explicitly via new conditions, the {\textbackslash}emph\{Dynamical Complementarity Constraints\}. The approach does not require a predefined contact sequence and generates the footsteps automatically. We characterize the robot control objective via a set of tasks, and we address it by solving an optimal control problem. We show that it is possible to achieve walking motions automatically by specifying a minimal set of references, such as a constant desired center of mass velocity and a reference point on the ground. Furthermore, we analyze how the contact modelling choices affect the computational time. We validate the approach by generating and testing walking trajectories for the humanoid robot iCub.},

	abstract = {Navigation planning for legged robots has distinct challenges compared to wheeled and tracked systems due to the ability to lift legs off the ground and step over obstacles. While most navigation planners assume a fixed traversability value for a single terrain patch, we overcome this limitation by proposing a reachability-based navigation planner for legged robots. We approximate the robot morphology by a set of reachability and body volumes, assuming that the reachability volumes need to always be in contact with the environment, while the body should be contact-free. We train a convolutional neural network to predict foothold scores which are used to restrict geometries which are considered suitable to step on. Using this representation, we propose a navigation planner based on probabilistic roadmaps. Through validation of only low-cost graph edges during graph expansion and an adaptive sampling scheme based on roadmap node density, we achieve real-time performance with fast update rates even in cluttered and narrow environments. We thoroughly validate the proposed navigation planner in simulation and demonstrate its performance in real-world experiments on the quadruped ANYmal.},

	abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a popular strategy for controlling robots but is difficult for systems with contact due to the complex nature of hybrid dynamics. To implement MPC for systems with contact, dynamic models are often simplified or contact sequences fixed in time in order to plan trajectories efficiently. In this work, we extend Hybrid iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator to work in a MPC fashion (HiLQR MPC) by 1) modifying how the cost function is computed when contact modes do not align, 2) utilizing parallelizations when simulating rigid body dynamics, and 3) using efficient analytical derivative computations of the rigid body dynamics. The result is a system that can modify the contact sequence of the reference behavior and plan whole body motions cohesively -- which is crucial when dealing with large perturbations. HiLQR MPC is tested on two systems: first, the hybrid cost modification is validated on a simple actuated bouncing ball hybrid system. Then HiLQR MPC is compared against methods that utilize centroidal dynamic assumptions on a quadruped robot (Unitree A1). HiLQR MPC outperforms the centroidal methods in both simulation and hardware tests.},

At the core of our framework is a new steering method that generates trajectories connecting two states of the robot. These trajectories account for the state-dependent, centroidal dynamic constraints inherent to legged robots. The method, of low dimension, formulated as a Linear Program, is really efficient to compute, and can find an application in various problems related to legged locomotion.

We first use the completeness of a graph search on a regular grid to quickly find an initial path in a low dimensional space, considering only the platform's operating limits instead of the complete state. We then take this initial path to focus the RRT* search in the continuous high-dimensional state space including the actuators of the robot. We do not rely on a detailed structure/terrain classification or use any predefined motion sequences. Hence, our planner can be applied to urban structures, like stairs, as well as rough unstructured environments.

	abstract = {Dynamic bipedal walking on discrete terrain, like stepping stones, is a challenging problem requiring feedback controllers to enforce safety-critical constraints. To enforce such constraints in real-world experiments, fast and accurate perception for foothold detection and estimation is needed. In this work, a deep visual perception model is designed to accurately estimate step length of the next step, which serves as input to the feedback controller to enable vision-in-the-loop dynamic walking on discrete terrain. In particular, a custom convolutional neural network architecture is designed and trained to predict step length to the next foothold using a sampled image preview of the upcoming terrain at foot impact. The visual input is offered only at the beginning of each step and is shown to be sufficient for the job of dynamically stepping onto discrete footholds. Through extensive numerical studies, we show that the robot is able to successfully autonomously walk for over 100 steps without failure on a discrete terrain with footholds randomly positioned within a step length range of [45 : 85] centimeters.},

To represent the policies, we employ a mixture-of-experts network (MEN) and observe that the performance of a policy improves if each expert of a MEN specializes in controlling exactly one mode of a hybrid system, such as a walking robot. We introduce new loss functions for single- and multi-gait policies to achieve this kind of expert selection behavior. Moreover, we benchmark our algorithm against Behavioral Cloning and the original MPC implementation on various rough terrain scenarios.

	abstract = {Legged locomotion is commonly studied and expressed as a discrete set of gait patterns, like walk, trot, gallop, which are usually treated as given and pre-programmed in legged robots for efficient locomotion at different speeds. However, fixing a set of pre-programmed gaits limits the generality of locomotion. Recent animal motor studies show that these conventional gaits are only prevalent in ideal flat terrain conditions while real-world locomotion is unstructured and more like bouts of intermittent steps. What principles could lead to both structured and unstructured patterns across mammals and how to synthesize them in robots? In this work, we take an analysis-by-synthesis approach and learn to move by minimizing mechanical energy. We demonstrate that learning to minimize energy consumption plays a key role in the emergence of natural locomotion gaits at different speeds in real quadruped robots. The emergent gaits are structured in ideal terrains and look similar to that of horses and sheep. The same approach leads to unstructured gaits in rough terrains which is consistent with the findings in animal motor control. We validate our hypothesis in both simulation and real hardware across natural terrains. Videos at https://energy-locomotion.github.io},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising tool for developing controllers for quadrupedal locomotion. The design of most learning-based locomotion controllers adopts the joint position-based paradigm, wherein a low-frequency RL policy outputs target joint positions that are then tracked by a high-frequency proportional-derivative (PD) controller that outputs joint torques. However, the low frequency of such a policy hinders the advancement of highly dynamic locomotion behaviors. Moreover, determining the PD gains for optimal tracking performance is laborious and dependent on the task at hand. In this paper, we introduce a learning torque control framework for quadrupedal locomotion, which trains an RL policy that directly predicts joint torques at a high frequency, thus circumventing the use of PD controllers. We validate the proposed framework with extensive experiments where the robot is able to both traverse various terrains and resist external pushes, given user-specified commands. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt of learning torque control for quadrupedal locomotion with an end-to-end single neural network that has led to successful real-world experiments among recent research on learning-based quadrupedal locomotion which is mostly position-based.},

The resulting discrete planner satisfies the given task specifications expressed in a fragment of temporal logic. The resulting commands are executed by a low-level 3D phase-space motion planner algorithm. We devise various low-level locomotion modes based on centroidal momentum dynamics.

	abstract = {This paper reports on developing an integrated framework for safety-aware informative motion planning suitable for legged robots. The information-gathering planner takes a dense stochastic map of the environment into account, while safety constraints are enforced via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). The planner is based on the Incrementally-exploring Information Gathering (IIG) algorithm and allows closed-loop kinodynamic node expansion using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formalism. Robotic exploration and information gathering problems are inherently path-dependent problems. That is, the information collected along a path depends on the state and observation history. As such, motion planning solely based on a modular cost does not lead to suitable plans for exploration. We propose SAFE-IIG, an integrated informative motion planning algorithm that takes into account: 1) a robot's perceptual field of view via a submodular information function computed over a stochastic map of the environment, 2) a robot's dynamics and safety constraints via discrete-time CBFs and MPC for closed-loop multi-horizon node expansions, and 3) an automatic stopping criterion via setting an information-theoretic planning horizon. The simulation results show that SAFE-IIG can plan a safe and dynamically feasible path while exploring a dense map.},

In the past ten years, researchers have done a lot of research on the ability of the quadruped robot to cope with the complex environment and published many results in order to make the working environment of the quadruped robot closer to reality. This paper collected these research results and divided these literatures into three categories according to different situations: crossing challenging terrain, walking on slope, and coping with interference, respectively, introducing representative methods. The purpose of this review is to summarize and analyze the previous research results and provide guidance for future research on quadruped robots in complex situations.},

	abstract = {An important issue when synthesizing legged locomotion plans is the combinatorial complexity that arises from gait pattern selection. Though it can be defined manually, the gait pattern plays an important role in the feasibility and optimality of a motion with respect to a task. Replacing human intuition with an automatic and efficient approach for gait pattern selection would allow for more autonomous robots, responsive to task and environment changes. To this end, we propose the idea of building a map from task to gait pattern selection for given environment and performance objective. Indeed, we show that for a 2D half-cheetah model and a quadruped robot, a direct mapping between a given task and an optimal gait pattern can be established. We use supervised learning to capture the structure of this map in a form of gait regions. Furthermore, we propose to construct a warm-starting trajectory for each gait region. We empirically show that these warm-starting trajectories improve the convergence speed of our trajectory optimization problem up to 60 times when compared with random initial guesses. Finally, we conduct experimental trials on the ANYmal robot to validate our method.},

Moreover, we show that by using a Wasserstein GAN formulation and transitions from demonstrations with rough and partial information as input, we are able to extract policies that are robust and capable of imitating demonstrated behaviors.

	abstract = {When traversing uneven terrain, humans consider their future steps for choosing the best location and timing of their current step. Likewise, when planning multi-contact motions for legged robots (e.g. humanoids), a ‘prediction horizon’ has to be considered. However, planning several steps ahead increases the dimensionality and non-linearity of an already challenging problem, which makes online planning intractable. We propose to reduce the problem complexity by using convex relaxations in the prediction horizon. We realize this idea within a Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) framework to plan dynamically consistent centroidal trajectories of humanoid walking on uneven terrain. This results in a novel formulation that combines an accurate non-convex model with a relaxed convex model, which we call RHP with multiple levels of model fidelity. We evaluate three candidate multi-fidelity RHPs with convex relaxations of the centroidal dynamics in the prediction horizon. The best candidate is 1.4x-3.0x (average 2.4x) faster than the traditional RHP that employs a single dynamics model over the entire look-ahead horizon. We also validate the resultant centroidal trajectories by tracking them with a whole-body inverse dynamics controller in simulation. Lastly, we find that incorporating angular dynamics in the prediction horizon is important to the success of multi-fidelity RHP.},

Rejecting perturbations is an essential capability of bipedal robots and has been widely studied in the locomotion literature. However, adversarial disturbances and aggressive turning can lead to negative lateral step width (i.e., crossed-leg scenarios) with unstable motions and self-collision risks. These motion planning problems are computationally difficult and have not been explored under a hierarchically integrated task and motion planning method. We explore a planning and decision-making framework that closely ties linear-temporal-logic-based reactive synthesis with trajectory optimization incorporating the robot's full-body dynamics, kinematics, and leg collision avoidance constraints. Between the high-level discrete symbolic decision-making and the low-level continuous motion planning, behavior trees serve as a reactive interface to handle perturbations occurring at any time of the locomotion process. Our experimental results show the efficacy of our method in generating resilient recovery behaviors in response to diverse perturbations from any direction with bounded magnitudes.},

	abstract = {This study proposes a hierarchically integrated framework for safe task and motion planning (TAMP) of bipedal locomotion in a partially observable environment with dynamic obstacles and uneven terrain. The high-level task planner employs linear temporal logic (LTL) for a reactive game synthesis between the robot and its environment and provides a formal guarantee on navigation safety and task completion. To address environmental partial observability, a belief abstraction is employed at the high-level navigation planner to estimate the dynamic obstacles’ location. Accordingly, a synthesized action planner sends a set of locomotion actions to the middle-level motion planner, while incorporating safe locomotion specifications extracted from safety theorems based on a reduced-order model (ROM) of the locomotion process. The motion planner employs the ROM to design safety criteria and a sampling algorithm to generate nonperiodic motion plans that accurately track high-level actions. To address external perturbations, this study also investigates safe sequential composition of the keyframe locomotion state and achieves robust transitions against external perturbations through reachability analysis. A set of ROM-based hyperparameters are finally interpolated to design whole-body locomotion gaits generated by trajectory optimization and validate the viable deployment of the ROM-based TAMP on a 20-degrees-of-freedom Cassie robot designed by Agility Robotics.},

Formal synthesis methods derived from symbolic systems have great potential for reasoning about high-level locomotion decisions and achieving complex maneuvering behaviors with correctness guarantees. This study takes a first step toward formally devising an architecture composed of task planning and control of whole-body dynamic locomotion behaviors in constrained and dynamically changing environments. At the high level, we formulate a two-player temporal logic game between the multi-limb locomotion planner and its dynamic environment to synthesize a winning strategy that delivers symbolic locomotion actions. These locomotion actions satisfy the desired high-level task specifications expressed in a fragment of temporal logic. Those actions are sent to a robust finite transition system that synthesizes a locomotion controller that fulfills state reachability constraints. This controller is further executed via a low-level motion planner that generates feasible locomotion trajectories. We construct a set of dynamic locomotion models for legged robots to serve as a template library for handling diverse environmental events. We devise a replanning strategy that takes into consideration sudden environmental changes or large state disturbances to increase the robustness of the resulting locomotion behaviors. We formally prove the correctness of the layered locomotion framework guaranteeing a robust implementation by the motion planning layer. Simulations of reactive locomotion behaviors in diverse environments indicate that our framework has the potential to serve as a theoretical foundation for intelligent locomotion behaviors.},

	abstract = {Despite extensive studies on motion stabilization of bipeds, they still suffer from the lack of disturbance coping capability on slippery surfaces. In this paper, a novel controller for stabilizing a bipedal motion in its sagittal plane is developed with regard to the surface friction limitations. By taking into account the physical limitation of the surface in the stabilization trend, a more advanced level of reliability is achieved that provides higher functionalities such as push recovery on low-friction surfaces and prevents the stabilizer from overreacting. The discrete event-based strategy consists of modifying the step length and time period at the beginning of each footstep in order to reestablish stability necessary conditions while taking into account the surface friction limitation as a constraint to prevent slippage. Adjusting footsteps to prevent slippage in confronting external disturbances is perceived as a novel strategy for keeping stability, quite similar to human reaction. The developed methodology consists of rough closed-form solutions utilizing elementary math operations for obtaining the control inputs, allowing to reach a balance between convergence and computational cost, which is quite suitable for real-time operations even with modest computational hardware. Several numerical simulations, including push recovery and switching between different gates on low-friction surfaces, are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. In correlation with human-gait experience, the results also reveal some physical aspects favoring stability and the fact of switching between gaits to reduce the risk of falling in confronting different conditions.},

We believe that these limits gain paramount importance when the complexity of the terrains to be traversed increases. We build on previous research from the field of robotic grasping to propose two new six-dimensional bounded polytopes named the Actuation Wrench Polytope (AWP) and the Feasible Wrench Polytope (FWP). We define the AWP as the set of all the wrenches that a robot can generate while considering its actuation limits. This considers the admissible contact forces that the robot can generate given its current configuration and actuation capabilities. The Contact Wrench Cone (CWC) instead includes features of the environment such as the contact normal or the friction coefficient. The intersection of the AWP and of the CWC results in a convex polytope, the FWP, which turns out to be more descriptive of the real robot capabilities than existing simplified models, while maintaining the same compact representation. We explain how to efficiently compute the vertex-description of the FWP that is then used to evaluate a feasibility factor that we adapted from the field of robotic grasping [1]. This allows us to optimize for robustness to external disturbance wrenches. Based on this, we present an implementation of a motion planner for our quadruped robot HyQ that provides online Center of Mass (CoM) trajectories that are guaranteed to be statically stable and actuation-consistent.},

With this approach, we can accurately capture the robot’s rolling constraint and dynamics, enabling automatic discovery of hybrid maneuvers without needless motion heuristics. The formulation’s generality through the simultaneous optimization over the robot’s whole-body variables allows for a single set of parameters and makes online gait sequence adaptation possible. Aperiodic gait sequences are automatically found through kinematic leg utilities without the need for predefined contact and lift-off timings, reducing the cost of transport by up to 85 \%.

This strategy requires trial and error to identify leg timings, which may not be suitable in challenging terrains. In this letter, we introduce new concepts to quantify leg capabilities for online gait emergence and adaptation, without fixed timings or predefined foothold sequences. Specifically, we introduce the Feasible Impulse Set, a notion that extends aspects of the classical wrench cone to include a prediction horizon into the future. By considering the impulses that can be delivered by the legs, quantified notions of leg utility are proposed for coordinating adaptive lift-off and touch-down of stance legs. The proposed methods provide push recovery and emergent gait transitions with speed. These advances are validated in experiments with the MIT Cheetah 3 robot, where the framework is shown to automatically coordinate aperiodic behaviors on a partially moving walkway.},

We use evolutionary strategies (ES) to train a high-level gait policy that specifies gait patterns of each foot, while the low-level convex MPC controller optimizes the motor commands so that the robot can walk at a desired velocity using that gait pattern. We test our learning framework on a quadruped robot and demonstrate automatic gait transitions, from walking to trotting and to fly-trotting, as the robot increases its speed. We show that the learned hierarchical controller consumes much less energy across a wide range of locomotion speed than baseline controllers.},

Essential to this is the ability to combine traditional “ankle strategy” balancing with step timing and location adjustment techniques. In doing so, the robot is able to step quickly to the necessary location to continue walking. In this work, we present both a new swing speed up algorithm to adjust the step timing, allowing the robot to set the foot down more quickly to recover from errors in the direction of the current capture point dynamics, and a new algorithm to adjust the desired footstep, expanding the base of support to utilize the center of pressure (CoP)-based ankle strategy for balance. We then utilize the desired centroidal moment pivot (CMP) to calculate the momentum rate of change for our inverse-dynamics based whole-body controller.

We show that RL-based control of the accelerations of a centroidal model is surprisingly effective, when combined with a quadratic program to realize the commanded actions via ground contact forces. It allows for a simple reward structure, reduced computational costs, and robust sim-to-real transfer. We show the generality of the method by demonstrating flat-terrain gaits, stepping-stone locomotion, two-legged in-place balance, balance beam locomotion, and direct sim-to-real transfer.},

	abstract = {Humanoid robots dynamically navigate an environment by interacting with it via contact wrenches exerted at intermittent contact poses. Therefore, it is important to consider dynamics when planning a contact sequence. Traditional contact planning approaches assume a quasi-static balance criterion to reduce the computational challenges of selecting a contact sequence over a rough terrain. This however limits the applicability of the approach when dynamic motions are required, such as when walking down a steep slope or crossing a wide gap. Recent methods overcome this limitation with the help of efficient mixed integer convex programming solvers capable of synthesizing dynamic contact sequences. Nevertheless, its exponential-time complexity limits its applicability to short time horizon contact sequences within small environments. In this paper, we go beyond current approaches by learning a prediction of the dynamic evolution of the robot centroidal momenta, which can then be used for quickly generating dynamically robust contact sequences for robots with arms and legs using a search-based contact planner. We demonstrate the efficiency and quality of the results of the proposed approach in a set of dynamically challenging scenarios.},

However, to tackle more challenging tasks and scenarios such as locomotion on uneven terrain, a more expressive model is required. In this paper, we are interested in contact interaction-centered motion optimization based on the momentum dynamics model. This model is non-linear and non-convex; however, we find a relaxation of the problem that allows us to formulate it as a single convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) that can be very efficiently optimized and is useful for multi-contact planning. This convex model is then coupled to the optimization of end-effector contact locations using a mixed integer program, which can also be efficiently solved. This becomes relevant e.g. to recover from external pushes, where a predefined stepping plan is likely to fail and an online adaptation of the contact location is needed. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated in several multi-contact scenarios for a humanoid robot.},

Previous approaches use fixed gait sequences, and rely on Zero Moment Point (ZMP) to guarantee dynamic stability. While this combination works well on flat ground, it does not generalize to uneven terrain requiring aggressive gait or gait transition. To overcome such difficulties, in this paper, we present an optimization framework, that can plan both the contact location and gait sequence simultaneously in a mixed-integer convex optimization program. Moreover, we rely on the Contact Wrench Cone (CWC) stability criterion, which generalizes the ZMP criterion to uneven terrain with friction cone constraints, and we plan the walking motion together with the angular momentum through a convex optimization program. Our approach is successfully tested on a LittleDog quadruped over simulated scenarios. We show that on the flat ground, our planner generates a periodic gait, same as Central Pattern Generator + ZMP planner; while on uneven terrain, our planner can successfully generate a motion containing different gaits, with a center-of-mass motion that respects the friction cone constraints, which are violated by ZMP planners. This improvement clearly demonstrates the advantage of our approach over traditional planning strategies.},

This article proposes a disturbance observer-based cascaded model predictive control (MPC) approach for bipedal locomotion, with the capability of exploiting ankle, stepping, hip and height variation strategies. Specifically, based on the variable-height inverted pendulum model, a nonlinear MPC that is run at a low frequency is built for 3-D locomotion (i.e., with height variation) while accounting for the footstep modulation as well. Differing from previous works, the nonlinear MPC is formulated as a convex optimization problem by semidefinite relaxation. Subsequently, assuming a flywheel at the pelvis center, a linear MPC that is run at a high frequency is proposed to regulate angular momentum (e.g., through rotating the upper body), which is solved by convex quadratic programming. To run the cascaded MPC in a closed-loop manner, a high order sliding mode observer is designed to estimate system states and dynamic disturbances simultaneously. Simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the walking robustness in real-world scenarios, including 3-D walking with varying speeds, walking across non-coplanar terrains and push recovery.},

The sim2real method in [11] learns an adaptive policy conditioned on a latent space that implicitly encodes the physics parameters of its environment. Samples must be collected on the robot to learn a latent space corresponding to the physics of the real world. In [6], the authors also employ a learned latent space, but constrain the mutual information between the latent variables and the input.

Using this insight, we propose a novel walking pattern generator that optimally selects step location and timing at every control cycle. Our approach is computationally simple compared to standard approaches in the literature, yet guarantees that any viable state will remain viable in the future. We propose a swing foot adaptation strategy and integrate the pattern generator with an inverse dynamics controller that does not explicitly control the center of mass nor the foot center of pressure. This is particularly useful for biped robots with limited control authority over their foot center of pressure, such as robots with point feet or passive ankles. Extensive simulations on a humanoid robot with passive ankles demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in various walking situations, including external pushes and foot slippage, and emphasize the importance of step timing adaptation to stabilize walking.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a convex optimization problem to generate Center of Mass (CoM) and momentum trajectories of a walking robot, such that the motion robustly satisfies the friction cone constraints on uneven terrain. We adopt the Contact Wrench Cone (CWC) criterion to measure a robot's dynamical stability, which generalizes the venerable Zero Moment Point (ZMP) criterion. Unlike the ZMP criterion, which is ideal for walking on flat ground with unbounded tangential friction forces, the CWC criterion incorporates non-coplanar contacts with friction cone constraints. We measure the robustness of the motion using the margin in the Contact Wrench Cone at each time instance, which quantifies the capability of the robot to instantaneously resist external force/torque disturbance, without causing the foot to tip over or slide. For pre-specified footstep location and time, we formulate a convex optimization problem to search for robot linear and angular momenta that satisfy the CWC criterion. We aim to maximize the CWC margin to improve the robustness of the motion, and minimize the centroidal angular momentum (angular momentum about CoM) to make the motion natural. Instead of directly minimizing the non-convex centroidal angular momentum, we resort to minimizing a convex upper bound. We show that our CWC planner can generate motion similar to the result of the ZMP planner on flat ground with sufficient friction. Moreover, on an uneven terrain course with friction cone constraints, our CWC planner can still find feasible motion, while the outcome of the ZMP planner violates the friction limit.},

Therefore, we propose a 3D reconstruction model that faithfully reconstructs the scene, despite the noisy measurements and large amounts of missing data coming from the blind spots of the camera arrangement. The model consists of a 4D fully convolutional network on point clouds that learns the geometric priors to complete the scene from the context and an auto-regressive feedback to leverage spatio-temporal consistency and use evidence from the past. The network can be solely trained with synthetic data, and due to extensive augmentation, it is robust in the real world, as shown in the validation on a quadrupedal robot, ANYmal, traversing challenging settings.

	abstract = {Legged robots require knowledge of pose and velocity in order to maintain stability and execute walking paths. Current solutions either rely on vision data, which is susceptible to environmental and lighting conditions, or fusion of kinematic and contact data with measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this work, we develop a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) using the theory of Lie groups and invariant observer design. This filter combines contact-inertial dynamics with forward kinematic corrections to estimate pose and velocity along with all current contact points. We show that the error dynamics follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation with several important consequences: (a) the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain of attraction that is independent of the system?s trajectory; (b) unlike the standard EKF, neither the linearized error dynamics nor the linearized observation model depend on the current state estimate, which (c) leads to improved convergence properties and (d) a local observability matrix that is consistent with the underlying nonlinear system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to include IMU biases, add/remove contacts, and formulate both world-centric and robo-centric versions. We compare the convergence of the proposed InEKF with the commonly used quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) through both simulations and experiments on a Cassie-series bipedal robot. Filter accuracy is analyzed using motion capture, while a LiDAR mapping experiment provides a practical use case. Overall, the developed contact-aided InEKF provides better performance in comparison with the quaternion-based EKF as a result of exploiting symmetries present in system.},

	abstract = {Template-based reduced-order models have provided a popular methodology for real-time trajectory planning of dynamic quadrupedal locomotion. However, the abstraction and unmodeled dynamics in template models significantly increase the gap between reduced- and full-order models. This letter presents a computationally tractable robust model predictive control (RMPC) formulation, based on convex quadratic programs (QP), to bridge this gap. The RMPC framework considers the single rigid body model subject to a set of unmodeled dynamics and plans for the optimal reduced-order trajectory and ground reaction forces (GRFs). The generated optimal GRFs of the high-level RMPC are then mapped to the full-order model using a low-level nonlinear controller based on virtual constraints and QP. The proposed hierarchical control framework is employed for locomotion over rough terrains. We leverage deep reinforcement learning to train a neural network to compute the set of unmodeled dynamics for the RMPC framework. The proposed controller is finally validated via extensive numerical simulations and experiments for robust and blind locomotion of the A1 quadrupedal robot on different terrains.},

	abstract = {A major challenge in reinforcement learning is specifying tasks in a manner that is both interpretable and verifiable. One common approach is to specify tasks through reward machines -- finite state machines that encode the task to be solved. We introduce skill machines, a representation that can be learned directly from these reward machines that encode the solution to such tasks. We propose a framework where an agent first learns a set of base skills in a reward-free setting, and then combines these skills with the learned skill machine to produce composite behaviours specified by any regular language, such as linear temporal logics. This provides the agent with the ability to map from complex logical task specifications to near-optimal behaviours zero-shot. We demonstrate our approach in both a tabular and high-dimensional video game environment, where an agent is faced with several of these complex, long-horizon tasks. Our results indicate that the agent is capable of satisfying extremely complex task specifications, producing near optimal performance with no further learning. Finally, we demonstrate that the performance of skill machines can be improved with regular offline reinforcement learning algorithms when optimal behaviours are desired.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14523},
	abstract = {The wide availability of data coupled with the computational advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning promise to enable many future technologies such as autonomous driving. While there has been a variety of successful demonstrations of these technologies, critical system failures have repeatedly been reported. Even if rare, such system failures pose a serious barrier to adoption without a rigorous risk assessment. This paper presents a framework for the systematic and rigorous risk verification of systems. We consider a wide range of system specifications formulated in signal temporal logic (STL) and model the system as a stochastic process, permitting discrete-time and continuous-time stochastic processes. We then define the STL robustness risk as the risk of lacking robustness against failure. This definition is motivated as system failures are often caused by missing robustness to modeling errors, system disturbances, and distribution shifts in the underlying data generating process. Within the definition, we permit general classes of risk measures and focus on tail risk measures such as the value-at-risk and the conditional value-at-risk. While the STL robustness risk is in general hard to compute, we propose the approximate STL robustness risk as a more tractable notion that upper bounds the STL robustness risk. We show how the approximate STL robustness risk can accurately be estimated from system trajectory data. For discrete-time stochastic processes, we show under which conditions the approximate STL robustness risk can even be computed exactly. We illustrate our verification algorithm in the autonomous driving simulator CARLA and show how a least risky controller can be selected among four neural network lane keeping controllers for five meaningful system specifications.},

In this paper, we describe and analyze ACHORD (Autonomous \& Collaborative High-Bandwidth Operations with Radio Droppables), a multi-layer networking solution which tightly co-designs the network architecture and high-level decision-making for improved comms. ACHORD provides bandwidth prioritization and timely and reliable data transfer despite intermittent connectivity. Furthermore, it exposes low-layer networking metrics to the application layer to enable robots to autonomously monitor, map, and extend the network via droppable radios, as well as restore connectivity to improve collaborative exploration. We evaluate our solution with respect to the comms performance in several challenging underground environments including the DARPA SubT Finals competition environment.

	abstract = {We describe an optimization-based framework to perform complex locomotion skills for robots with legs and wheels. The generation of complex motions over a long-time horizon often requires offline computation due to current computing constraints and is mostly accomplished through trajectory optimization (TO). In contrast, model predictive control (MPC) focuses on the online computation of trajectories, robust even in the presence of uncertainty, albeit mostly over shorter time horizons and is prone to generating nonoptimal solutions over the horizon of the task’s goals. Our article’s contributions overcome this trade-off by combining offline motion libraries and online MPC, uniting a complex, long-time horizon plan with reactive, short-time horizon solutions. We start from offline trajectories that can be, for example, generated by TO or sampling-based methods. Also, multiple offline trajectories can be composed out of a motion library into a single maneuver. We then use these offline trajectories as the cost for the online MPC, allowing us to smoothly blend between multiple composed motions even in the presence of discontinuous transitions. The MPC optimizes from the measured state, resulting in feedback control, which robustifies the task’s execution by reacting to disturbances and looking ahead at the offline trajectory. With our contribution, motion designers can choose their favorite method to iterate over behavior designs offline without tuning robot experiments, enabling them to author new behaviors rapidly. Our experiments demonstrate complex and dynamic motions on our traditional quadrupedal robot ANYmal and its roller-walking version. Moreover, the article’s findings contribute to evaluating five planning algorithms.},

Specifically, a linear MPC (LMPC) optimizes for the desired footstep location by linearizing the single rigid body dynamics with respect to the current footstep location. A low-level task-space controller tracks the predicted state and control trajectories from the LMPC to leverage the full-body dynamics. Finally, an adaptive gait frequency scheme is employed to modify the step frequency and enhance the robustness of the walking controller.

These lecture notes aim at supporting this unified view with a unified notation wherever possible, and a bit of a translation help to compare the terminology and notation in the different fields.

Typical policy search methods of this kind minimize a distance metric between the guiding demonstrations and the learned policy. Our loss function, however, corresponds to the minimization of the control Hamiltonian, which derives from the principle of optimality. Therefore, our algorithm directly attempts to solve the optimality conditions with a parameterized class of control laws. Additionally, the proposed loss function explicitly encodes the constraints of the optimal control problem and we provide numerical evidence that its minimization achieves improved constraint satisfaction. We train a mixture-of-expert neural network architecture for controlling a quadrupedal robot and show that this policy structure is well suited for such multimodal systems. The learned policy can successfully stabilize different gaits on the real walking robot from less than 10 min of demonstration data.},

	abstract = {Sequences and time-series often arise in robot tasks, e.g., in activity recognition and imitation learning. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as an effective data-driven methodology for processing sequences given sufficient training data and compute resources. However, when data is limited, simpler models such as logic/rule-based methods work surprisingly well, especially when relevant prior knowledge is applied in their construction. However, unlike DNNs, these "structured" models can be difficult to extend, and do not work well with raw unstructured data. In this work, we seek to learn flexible DNNs, yet leverage prior temporal knowledge when available. Our approach is to embed symbolic knowledge expressed as linear temporal logic (LTL) and use these embeddings to guide the training of deep models. Specifically, we construct semantic-based embeddings of automata generated from LTL formula via a Graph Neural Network. Experiments show that these learnt embeddings can lead to improvements on downstream robot tasks such as sequential action recognition and imitation learning.},

Approaches to locomotion based on model-based feedback control are robust to perturbations but cannot easily incorporate visual terrain information. Meanwhile, approaches to locomotion based on learning excel at associating visual sensory data with suitable control policies but often fail to generalize across the gap between simulation and deployment settings. This thesis proposes a trajectory-based abstraction for locomotion through which model-free and model-based control layers interface. This approach enables general visually guided locomotion while preserving robustness. We demonstrate that our proposed architecture allows the Mini Cheetah quadruped to match theoretical performance limits in a set of visual tasks.

	abstract = {Designing an actuator system for highly dynamic legged robots has been one of the grand challenges in robotics research. Conventional actuators for manufacturing applications have difficulty satisfying design requirements for high-speed locomotion, such as the need for high torque density and the ability to manage dynamic physical interactions. To address this challenge, this paper suggests a proprioceptive actuation paradigm that enables highly dynamic performance in legged machines. Proprioceptive actuation uses collocated force control at the joints to effectively control contact interactions at the feet under dynamic conditions. Modal analysis of a reduced leg model and dimensional analysis of DC motors address the main principles for implementation of this paradigm. In the realm of legged machines, this paradigm provides a unique combination of high torque density, high-bandwidth force control, and the ability to mitigate impacts through backdrivability. We introduce a new metric named the “impact mitigation factor” (IMF) to quantify backdrivability at impact, which enables design comparison across a wide class of robots. The MIT Cheetah leg is presented, and is shown to have an IMF that is comparable to other quadrupeds with series springs to handle impact. The design enables the Cheetah to control contact forces during dynamic bounding, with contact times down to 85 ms and peak forces over 450 N. The unique capabilities of the MIT Cheetah, achieving impact-robust force-controlled operation in high-speed three-dimensional running and jumping, suggest wider implementation of this holistic actuation approach.},

By including the absolute position of all footholds into the ﬁlter state, simple model equations can be formulated which accurately capture the uncertainties associated with the intermittent ground contacts. The resulting ﬁlter simultaneously estimates the position of all footholds and the pose of the main body. In the algorithmic formulation, special attention is paid to the consistency of the linearized ﬁlter: it maintains the same observability properties as the nonlinear system, which is a prerequisite for accurate state estimation.

The proposed approach formulates a feedback structure between the local QPs and assumes a one-step communication delay protocol. The properties of local QPs are analyzed, wherein it is established that their steady-state solutions on periodic orbits (representing gaits) coincide with that of the centralized QP. The asymptotic convergence of local QPs’ solutions to the steady-state solution is studied via Floquet theory. The effectiveness of the analytical results is evaluated through rigorous numerical simulations and various experiments on a quadrupedal robot, with the result being robust locomotion on different terrains and in the presence of external disturbances. The paper shows that the proposed distributed QPs have considerably less computation time and reduced noise propagation sensitivity than the centralized QP.},

Furthermore, at the joint configuration level, ADHERENT computes data-driven whole-body postural reference trajectories coherent with the generated footsteps, thus increasing the human likeness of the resulting robot motion. Extensive validations of the proposed architecture are presented with both simulations and real experiments on the iCub humanoid robot, thus demonstrating ADHERENT to be robust to varying step sizes and walking speeds.},

We show that the proposed controller can automatically adjust the contact location both in single and double support phases. The overall approach is then tested with a simulation of one-leg and two-leg systems performing jumping and running tasks, respectively.

However, that work, and most prior bipedal locomotion work, have not considered locomotion under a variety of external loads that can significantly influence the overall system dynamics. In many applications, robots will need to maintain robust locomotion under a wide range of potential dynamic loads, such as pulling a cart or carrying a large container of sloshing liquid, ideally without requiring additional load-sensing capabilities. In this work, we explore the capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL) and sim-to-real transfer for bipedal locomotion under dynamic loads using only proprioceptive feedback. We show that prior RL policies trained for unloaded locomotion fail for some loads and that simply training in the context of loads is enough to result in successful and improved policies. We also compare training specialized policies for each load versus a single policy for all considered loads and analyze how the resulting gaits change to accommodate different loads. Finally, we demonstrate sim-to-real transfer, which is successful but shows a wider sim-to-real gap than prior unloaded work, which points to interesting future research.},

	title = {Robust {High}-speed {Running} for {Quadruped} {Robots} via {Deep} {Reinforcement} {Learning}},
	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular and powerful way to develop locomotion controllers for quadruped robots. Common approaches have largely focused on learning actions directly in joint space, or learning to modify and offset foot positions produced by trajectory generators. Both approaches typically require careful reward shaping and training for millions of time steps, and with trajectory generators introduce human bias into the resulting control policies. In this paper, we instead explore learning foot positions in Cartesian space, which we track with impedance control, for a task of running as fast as possible subject to environmental disturbances. Compared with other action spaces, we observe less needed reward shaping, much improved sample efﬁciency, the emergence of natural gaits such as galloping and bounding, and ease of sim-to-sim transfer. Policies can be learned in only a few million time steps, even for challenging tasks of running over rough terrain with loads of over 100\% of the nominal quadruped mass. Training occurs in PyBullet, and we perform a sim-to-sim transfer to Gazebo, where our quadruped is able to run at over 4 m/s without a load, and 3.5 m/s with a 10 kg load, which is over 83\% of the nominal quadruped mass.

These methods heavily rely on accurate physics simulators, yet some aspects of the physical world, such as friction, can only be captured to a limited extent by most simulators. The goal of this paper is to leverage trajectory optimization for performing highly dynamic and complex tasks with robotic systems in absence of an accurate physics simulator. This is achieved by applying machine learning techniques to learn a differentiable dynamics model of the system from data. On the example of a Radio-controlled (RC) car, we show that from data collected in only 15 minutes of human-operated interactions with the car, a neural network is able to model highly nonlinear behaviors such as loss of traction and drifting. Furthermore, we use the analytical gradients of the neural network to perform gradient-based trajectory optimization, both in an ofﬂine and online setting. We ﬁnd that our learned model is able to represent complex physical behavior, like drifting and gives unprecedented performance in combination with trajectory optimization methods.},

We leverage the recent development of a reactive, vector field planner that provides guarantees of reachability to large regions of the environment even in the face of unknown or unforeseen obstacles. The reachability guarantees can be formalized using contracts that allow a deliberative planner to reason purely in terms of those contracts and synthesize a plan by choosing a sequence of reactive behaviors and their target configurations, without evaluating specific motion plans between targets. This reduces both the search depth at which plans will be found, and the number of samples required to ensure a plan exists, while crucially preserving correctness guarantees. The result is reduced computational cost of synthesizing plans, and increased robustness of generated plans to actuator noise, model misspecification, or unknown obstacles. Simulation studies show that our hierarchical planning and execution architecture can solve complex navigation and rearrangement tasks, even when faced with narrow passageways or incomplete world information.},

Locomotion on discontinuous terrains, such as those with gaps or obstacles, presents a complementary set of challenges. In discontinuous settings, it becomes necessary to plan ahead using visual inputs and to execute agile behaviors beyond robust walking, such as jumps. Such dynamic motion results in significant motion of onboard sensors, which introduces a new set of challenges for real-time visual processing. The requirement for agility and terrain awareness in this setting reinforces the need for robust control. We present Depth-based Impulse Control (DIC), a method for synthesizing highly agile visually-guided locomotion behaviors. DIC affords the flexibility of model-free learning but regularizes behavior through explicit model-based optimization of ground reaction forces.

	abstract = {Legged robots that can operate autonomously in remote and hazardous environments will greatly increase opportunities for exploration into under-explored areas. Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and energy-efficient locomotion: perceiving the terrain before making contact with it enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to maintain speed and stability. However, utilizing exteroceptive perception robustly for locomotion has remained a grand challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and water visually appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step{\textasciitilde}-- or are missing altogether due to high reflectance. Additionally, depth perception can degrade due to difficult lighting, dust, fog, reflective or transparent surfaces, sensor occlusion, and more. For this reason, the most robust and general solutions to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception. This severely limits locomotion speed, because the robot has to physically feel out the terrain before adapting its gait accordingly. Here we present a robust and general solution to integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception for legged locomotion. We leverage an attention-based recurrent encoder that integrates proprioceptive and exteroceptive input. The encoder is trained end-to-end and learns to seamlessly combine the different perception modalities without resorting to heuristics. The result is a legged locomotion controller with high robustness and speed. The controller was tested in a variety of challenging natural and urban environments over multiple seasons and completed an hour-long hike in the Alps in the time recommended for human hikers.},

This paper presents a framework that combines trajectory optimization and model predictive control to perform consecutive jumping on stepping stones. In our approach, we firstly utilize trajectory optimization for full-nonlinear dynamics to formulate periodic jumps for various jumping distances. A jumping controller based on model predictive control is then designed for dynamic jumping transitions, enabling the robot to achieve continuous jumps on stepping stones. The proposed framework is also validated to be robust to platforms with unknown height perturbations and model uncertainty (e.g. unknown load). Moreover, experiments are also conducted to show the robustness of our jumping controller on an unknown uneven platform.},

We show that the combination of parametric models, stochastic-based exploration and receding horizon planning allows us to handle the many local minima associated with different terrain conditions and walking patterns. This combination delivers robust motion plans without the need for warm-starting.

They optimize centroidal trajectories, contact forces and, importantly, the timing of the motions. We include the approach in a kino-dynamic optimization method to generate full-body movements. Finally, the approach is embedded in a mixed-integer solver to further find dynamically consistent contact sequences. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the computational efficiency of the approach, suggesting that it could be used in a fast receding horizon control loop.

The need for such a planner was shown at the DARPA Robotics Challenge, where such behaviors could not be demonstrated (except for egress). Current planners suffer from their prohibitive algorithmic complexity because they deploy a tree of robot configurations projected in contact with the environment. We tackle this issue by introducing a reduction property: the reachability condition. This condition defines a geometric approximation of the contact manifold, which is of low dimension, presents a Cartesian topology, and can be efficiently sampled and explored. The hard contact planning problem can then be decomposed into two subproblems: first, we plan a path for the root without considering the whole-body configuration, using a sampling-based algorithm; then, we generate a discrete sequence of whole-body configurations in static equilibrium along this path, using a deterministic contact-selection algorithm. The reduction breaks the algorithm complexity encountered in previous works, resulting in the first interactive implementation of a contact planner (open source). While no contact planner has yet been proposed with theoretical completeness, we empirically show the interest of our framework: in a few seconds, with high success rates, we generate complex contact plans for various scenarios and two robots: HRP-2 and HyQ. These plans are validated in dynamic simulations or on the real HRP-2 robot.},

To reduce the computational cost of MI, we exploit the sparsity properties of L1 norm minimization techniques to relax the contact planning problem into a feasibility linear program. Our approach accounts for kinematic reachability of the center of mass (COM) and of the contact effectors. We ensure the existence of a quasi-static COM trajectory by restricting our plan to quasi-flat contacts. For planning 10 steps with less than 10 potential contact surfaces for each phase, our approach is 50 to 100 times faster that its MI counterpart, which suggests potential applications for online contact re-planning.

	abstract = {We present a new method for planning footstep placements for a robot walking on uneven terrain with obstacles, using a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic program (MIQCQP). Our approach is unique in that it handles obstacle avoidance, kinematic reachability, and rotation of footstep placements, which typically have required non-convex constraints, in a single mixed-integer optimization that can be efficiently solved to its global optimum. Reachability is enforced through a convex inner approximation of the reachable space for the robot's feet. Rotation of the footsteps is handled by a piecewise linear approximation of sine and cosine, designed to ensure that the approximation never overestimates the robot's reachability. Obstacle avoidance is ensured by decomposing the environment into convex regions of obstacle-free configuration space and assigning each footstep to one such safe region. We demonstrate this technique in simple 2D and 3D environments and with real environments sensed by a humanoid robot. We also discuss computational performance of the algorithm, which is currently capable of planning short sequences of a few steps in under one second or longer sequences of 10-30 footsteps in tens of seconds to minutes on common laptop computer hardware. Our implementation is available within the Drake MATLAB toolbox [1].},

We would like to apply this useful theory to modern humanoids and other legged systems, for manipulation or similar tasks, however these systems present additional challenges due to their underactuated floating bases and contact states that can dynamically change. In recent work, Sentis et al. derived controllers for such systems by implementing a task Jacobian projected into a space consistent with the supporting constraints and underactuation (the so called support consistent reduced Jacobian). Here, we take a new approach to derive operational space controllers for constrained underactu­ ated systems, by first considering the operational space dynamics within projected inverse-dynamics (Aghili, 2005), and subsequently resolving underactuation through the addition of dynamically consistent control torques. Doing so results in a simplified control solution compared with previous results, and importantly yields several new insights into the underlying problem of operational space control in constrained environments: 1) Underactuated systems, such as humanoid robots, cannot in general completely decouple task and null space dynamics. However, 2) there may exist an infinite number of control solutions to realize desired task-space dynamics, and 3) these solutions involve the addition of dynamically consistent null space motion or constraint forces (or combinations of both). In light of these findings, we present several possible control solutions, with varying optimization criteria, and highlight some of their practical consequences.},

However, reasoning about contacts and motions simultaneously is crucial for the generation of complex whole-body behaviors. Currently, coupling theses problems has required either the assumption of a fixed gait sequence and flat terrain condition, or non-convex optimization with intractable computation time. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer convex formulation to plan simultaneously contact locations, gait transitions and motion, in a computationally efficient fashion. In contrast to previous works, our approach is not limited to flat terrain nor to a pre-specified gait sequence. Instead, we incorporate the friction cone stability margin, approximate the robot's torque limits, and plan the gait using mixed-integer convex constraints. We experimentally validated our approach on the HyQ robot by traversing different challenging terrains, where non-convexity and flat terrain assumptions might lead to sub-optimal or unstable plans.

Our method can discover stepping motions without a predeﬁned contact schedule. Moreover, the optimizer makes use of slipping contacts if a no-slip condition is too restrictive for the task at hand. Additionally, we show that new behaviors like skating over slippery surfaces emerge automatically, which would not be possible with classical methods that assume stationary contact points.

	abstract = {Synthesizing legged locomotion requires planning one or several steps ahead (literally): when and where, and with which effector should the next contact(s) be created between the robot and the environment? Validating a contact candidate implies a minima the resolution of a slow, nonlinear optimization problem, to demonstrate that a center of mass (CoM) trajectory, compatible with the contact transition constraints, exists. We propose a conservative reformulation of this trajectory generation problem as a convex 3-D linear program, named convex resolution of centroidal dynamic trajectories (CROC). It results from the observation that if the CoM trajectory is a polynomial with only one free variable coefficient, the nonlinearity of the problem disappears. This has two consequences. On the positive side, in terms of computation times, CROC outperforms the state of the art by at least one order of magnitude, and allows to consider interactive applications (with a planning time roughly equal to the motion time). On the negative side, in our experiments, our approach finds a majority of the feasible trajectories found by a nonlinear solver, but not all of them. Still, we demonstrate that the solution space covered by CROC is large enough to achieve the automated planning of a large variety of locomotion tasks for different robots, demonstrated in simulation and on the real HRP-2 robot, several of which were rarely seen before. Another significant contribution is the introduction of a Bezier curve representation of the problem, which guarantees that the constraints of the CoM trajectory are verified continuously, and not only at discrete points as traditionally done. This formulation is lossless, and results in more robust trajectories. It is not restricted to CROC, but could rather be integrated with any method from the state of the art.},

A hardcontact model is assumed, and the unilateral constraints are imposed in the form of complementarity conditions. Newton’s impact law is adopted for enhanced physical correctness. The optimal control problem is formulated as a multi-staged program through a multiple-shooting scheme. This problem structure is exploited within the FORCES Pro framework to retrieve optimal motion plans, contact sequences and control inputs with increased computational efﬁciency. We investigate our method on a variety of dynamic object manipulation tasks, performed by a six degrees of freedom robot. The dynamic feasibility of the optimal trajectories, as well as the repeatability and accuracy of the task-satisfaction are veriﬁed through simulations and real hardware experiments on one of the manipulation problems.},

TROSS iteratively improves trajectories by solving a sequence of subproblems setup within evolving trust regions around current iterates using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). TROSS achieves consensus among competing objectives, such as ﬁnding lowcost dynamically feasible trajectories respecting control limits and safety constraints. A library of building blocks in the form of inexpensive and parallelizable proximal operators associated with trajectory costs and constraints can be used to conﬁgure the solver for a variety of tasks. The method shows faster cost reduction compared to iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) on a control-limited vehicle maneuvering task. We demonstrate TROSS on shortest-path navigation of a variant of Dubin’s car in the presence of obstacles, while exploiting passive dynamics of the system. When applied to a constrained robust state estimation problem involving nondifferentiable nonconvex penalties, TROSS shows less susceptibility to non-Gaussian dynamics disturbances and measurement outliers in comparison to an Extended Kalman smoother. Unlike generic SQP methods, our approach produces time-varying linear feedback control policies even for constrained control tasks. The solver is potentially suitable for nonlinear model predictive control and moving horizon state estimation in embedded systems.},

The contact impulse is the solution to a convex optimization problem: minimize kinetic energy in contact space subject to non-penetration and friction-cone constraints. We use a custom interior-point method to make the optimization problem unconstrained; this is key to defining the forward and inverse dynamics in a consistent way. The resulting model has a parameter which sets the amount of contact smoothing, facilitating continuation methods for optimization.

The method uses an operator splitting method, the alternating directions method of multipliers, to solve the homogeneous self-dual embedding, an equivalent feasibility problem involving finding a nonzero point in the intersection of a subspace and a cone. This approach has several favorable properties. Compared to interior-point methods, first-order methods scale to very large problems, at the cost of requiring more time to reach very high accuracy. Compared to other first-order methods for cone programs, our approach finds both primal and dual solutions when available or a certificate of infeasibility or unboundedness otherwise, is parameter free, and the per-iteration cost of the method is the same as applying a splitting method to the primal or dual alone. We discuss efficient implementation of the method in detail, including direct and indirect methods for computing projection onto the subspace, scaling the original problem data, and stopping criteria. We describe an open-source implementation, which handles the usual (symmetric) nonnegative, second-order, and semidefinite cones as well as the (non-self-dual) exponential and power cones and their duals. We report numerical results that show speedups over interior-point cone solvers for large problems, and scaling to very large general cone programs.},

Crocoddyl efficiently computes the state trajectory and the control policy for a given predefined sequence of contacts. Its efficiency is due to the use of sparse analytical derivatives, exploitation of the problem structure, and data sharing. It employs differential geometry to properly describe the state of any geometrical system, e.g. floating-base systems. We have unified dynamics, costs, and constraints into a single concept -- action -- for greater efficiency and easy prototyping. Additionally, we propose a novel multiple-shooting method called Feasibility-prone Differential Dynamic Programming (FDDP). Our novel method shows a greater globalization strategy compared to classical Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithms, and it has similar numerical behavior to state-of-the-art multiple-shooting methods. However, our method does not increase the computational complexity typically encountered by adding extra variables to describe the gaps in the dynamics. Concretely, we propose two modifications to the classical DDP algorithm. First, the backward pass accepts infeasible state-control trajectories. Second, the rollout keeps the gaps open during the early "exploratory" iterations (as expected in multiple-shooting methods). We showcase the performance of our framework using different tasks. With our method, we can compute highly-dynamic maneuvers for legged robots (e.g. jumping, front-flip) in the order of milliseconds.},

	abstract = {Advanced humanoid robots highlight the ability of fast walking and adaptability to uneven terrain. However, owing to the complexity in walking dynamics, disturbances introduced by terrain height variations can adversely affect the bipedal walking performance. Moreover, to generate periodic gaits, most methods require to solve the gait generation problem by using nonlinear optimization approaches, resulting in difﬁculties for online control. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an online gait generation method to ﬁnd periodic gaits for fast walking on uneven terrain by using a pre-trained neural network. First, to enhance the terrain adaptability, this paper proposes an improved walking pattern that allows the robots to skip the last single support phase. Such improvement enlarges the feasible step region when stepping down. A compensation strategy is also proposed to reduce the velocity tracking error. Then the improved whale swarm algorithm (IWSA) is applied to generate various datasets that cover the ranges of target velocities and terrain height variations. A back-propagation (BP) network is employed to train these datasets ofﬂine to learn the gait dynamics, which is further used to generate the optimal trajectories. Simulation results suggest that, compared with the current methods, the proposed method can solve the walking return map in a short time, with improvements in both maximum walking speed and terrain adaptability.},

It requires to derive motion plans and local control feedback policies in real-time to handle the nonholonomy of the kinetic momenta. While a few recent predictive control approaches based on centroidal momentum have been able to generate dynamic motions, they assume unlimited actuation capabilities. This assumption is quite restrictive and does not hold for agile maneuvers on most robots. In this work, we present a contact-phase predictive and state-feedback controllers that enables legged robots to plan and perform agile locomotion skills. Our predictive controller models the contact phases using a hybrid paradigm that considers the robot's actuation limits and full dynamics. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on agile maneuvers on ANYmal robots in realistic scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to show that predictive control can handle actuation limits, generate agile locomotion maneuvers and execute locally optimal feedback policies on hardware without the use of a separate whole-body controller.},

We propose a decentralized route-planning method for a networked team of mobile robots to satisfy a common (global) LTL specification. The global specification is assumed to be a conjunction of multiple formulae, each of which is treated as a task to be assigned to one or more vehicles. The vehicle kinematic model consists of two modes: a hover mode and a constant-speed forward motion mode with bounded steering rate. The proposed method leverages the consensus-based bundle algorithm for decentralized task assignment, thereby decomposing the global specification into local specifications for each vehicle. We develop a new algorithm to assign collaborative tasks: those simultaneously assigned to multiple vehicles. Rewards in the proposed task assignment algorithm are computed using the so-called lifted graph, which ensures the satisfaction of minimum turn radius constraints on vehicular motion. This algorithm synchronizes the vehicles’ routes with minimum waiting durations. The proposed method is compared against a multi-vehicle task assignment algorithm from the literature, which we extend to apply for satisfying LTL specifications. The proposed route-planning method is demonstrated via numerical simulation examples and a hardware implementation on networked single-board computers.},

In this work we develop an online nonlinear model predictive control approach that leverages the full-order dynamics to realize diverse walking behaviors. Additionally, this approach can be coupled with gaits synthesized offline via a terminal cost that enables a shorter prediction horizon; this makes rapid online re-planning feasible and bridges the gap between online reactive control and offline gait planning.

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising tool for developing controllers for quadrupedal locomotion. The design of most learning-based locomotion controllers adopts the joint position-based paradigm, wherein a low-frequency RL policy outputs target joint positions that are then tracked by a high-frequency proportional-derivative (PD) controller that outputs joint torques. However, the low frequency of such a policy hinders the advancement of highly dynamic locomotion behaviors. Moreover, determining the PD gains for optimal tracking performance is laborious and dependent on the task at hand. In this paper, we introduce a learning torque control framework for quadrupedal locomotion, which trains an RL policy that directly predicts joint torques at a high frequency, thus circumventing the use of PD controllers. We validate the proposed framework with extensive experiments where the robot is able to both traverse various terrains and resist external pushes, given user-specified commands. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt of learning torque control for quadrupedal locomotion with an end-to-end single neural network that has led to successful real-world experiments among recent research on learning-based quadrupedal locomotion which is mostly position-based.},

	abstract = {Recently, work on reinforcement learning (RL) for bipedal robots has successfully learned controllers for a variety of dynamic gaits with robust sim-to-real demonstrations. In order to maintain balance, the learned controllers have full freedom of where to place the feet, resulting in highly robust gaits. In the real world however, the environment will often impose constraints on the feasible footstep locations, typically identified by perception systems. Unfortunately, most demonstrated RL controllers on bipedal robots do not allow for specifying and responding to such constraints. This missing control interface greatly limits the real-world application of current RL controllers. In this paper, we aim to maintain the robust and dynamic nature of learned gaits while also respecting footstep constraints imposed externally. We develop an RL formulation for training dynamic gait controllers that can respond to specified touchdown locations. We then successfully demonstrate simulation and sim-to-real performance on the bipedal robot Cassie. In addition, we use supervised learning to induce a transition model for accurately predicting the next touchdown locations that the controller can achieve given the robot's proprioceptive observations. This model paves the way for integrating the learned controller into a full-order robot locomotion planner that robustly satisfies both balance and environmental constraints.},

We ﬁrst propose a contact planner formulated as a mixed-integer program, optimized on-line at each new robot step.

	abstract = {Trajectory optimization is an efficient approach for solving optimal control problems for complex robotic systems. It relies on two key components: first the transcription into a sparse nonlinear program, and second the corresponding solver to iteratively compute its solution. On one hand, differential dynamic programming (DDP) provides an efficient approach to transcribe the optimal control problem into a finite-dimensional problem while optimally exploiting the sparsity induced by time. On the other hand, augmented Lagrangian methods make it possible to formulate efficient algorithms with advanced constraint-satisfaction strategies. In this paper, we propose to combine these two approaches into an efficient optimal control algorithm accepting both equality and inequality constraints. Based on the augmented Lagrangian literature, we first derive a generic primal-dual augmented Lagrangian strategy for nonlinear problems with equality and inequality constraints. We then apply it to the dynamic programming principle to solve the value-greedy optimization problems inherent to the backward pass of DDP, which we combine with a dedicated globalization strategy, resulting in a Newton-like algorithm for solving constrained trajectory optimization problems. Contrary to previous attempts of formulating an augmented Lagrangian version of DDP, our approach exhibits adequate convergence properties without any switch in strategies. We empirically demonstrate its interest with several case-studies from the robotics literature.},

While learning-based locomotion has made great advances using RL, most methods still rely on domain randomization for training blind agents that generalize to challenging terrains. Our key insight is that proprioceptive states only offer contact measurements for immediate reaction, whereas an agent equipped with visual sensory observations can learn to proactively maneuver environments with obstacles and uneven terrain by anticipating changes in the environment many steps ahead. In this paper, we introduce LocoTransformer, an end-to-end RL method that leverages both proprioceptive states and visual observations for locomotion control. We evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with different obstacles and uneven terrain. We transfer our learned policy from simulation to a real robot by running it indoor and in-the-wild with unseen obstacles and terrain. Our method not only significantly improves over baselines, but also achieves far better generalization performance, especially when transferred to the real robot.

	abstract = {In this letter, we aim to improve the robustness of dynamic quadrupedal locomotion through two aspects: 1) fast model predictive foothold planning, and 2) applying LQR to projected inverse dynamic control for robust motion tracking. In our proposed planning and control framework, foothold plans are updated at 400 Hz considering the current robot state and an LQR controller generates optimal feedback gains for motion tracking. The LQR optimal gain matrix with non-zero off-diagonal elements leverages the coupling of dynamics to compensate for system underactuation. Meanwhile, the projected inverse dynamic control complements the LQR to satisfy inequality constraints. In addition to these contributions, we show robustness of our control framework to unmodeled adaptive feet. Experiments on the quadruped ANYmal demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for robust dynamic locomotion given external disturbances and environmental uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Trajectory optimization is becoming increasingly powerful in addressing motion planning problems of under-actuated robotic systems. Numerous prior studies solve such a class of large non-convex optimal control problems in a hierarchical fashion. However, numerical accuracy issues are prone to occur when one uses a full-order model to track reference trajectories generated from a reduced-order model. This study investigates an approach of Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and proposes a new splitting scheme for legged locomotion problems. Rigid body dynamics constraints and other general constraints such as box and cone constraints are decomposed to multiple sub-problems in a principled manner. The resulting multi-block ADMM framework enables us to leverage the efficiency of an unconstrained optimization method-Differential Dynamical Programming-to iteratively solve the optimizations using centroidal and wholebody models. Furthermore, we propose a Stage-wise Accelerated ADMM with over-relaxation and varying-penalty schemes to improve the overall convergence rate. We evaluate and validate the performance of the proposed ADMM algorithm on a car-parking example and a bipedal locomotion problem over rough terrains.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a whole-body planning framework that uniﬁes dynamic locomotion and manipulation tasks by formulating a single multi-contact optimal control problem. We model the hybrid nature of a generic multi-limbed mobile manipulator as a switched system, and introduce a set of constraints that can encode any pre-deﬁned gait sequence or manipulation schedule in the formulation. Since the system is designed to actively manipulate its environment, the equations of motion are composed by augmenting the robot’s centroidal dynamics with the manipulated-object dynamics. This allows us to describe any high-level task in the same cost/constraint function. The resulting planning framework could be solved on the robot’s onboard computer in real-time within a model predictive control scheme. This is demonstrated in a set of real hardware experiments done in free-motion, such as base or end-effector pose tracking, and while pushing/pulling a heavy resistive door. Robustness against model mismatches and external disturbances is also veriﬁed during these test cases.},

Three function approximators are compared: \$k\$-Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Process Regression, and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Regression. In addition, we show that the memory can be used as a metric to choose between several possible goals, and using an ensemble method to combine different function approximators results in a significantly improved warm-starting performance.

	doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2018.8463154},
	abstract = {Predictive control is an efficient model-based methodology to control complex dynamical systems. In general, it boils down to the resolution at each control cycle of a large nonlinear optimization problem. A critical issue is then to provide a good guess to initialize the nonlinear solver so as to speed up convergence. This is particularly important when disturbances or changes in the environment prevent the use of the trajectory computed at the previous control cycle as initial guess. In this paper, we introduce an original and very efficient solution to automatically build this initial guess. We propose to rely on off-line computation to build an approximation of the optimal trajectories, that can be used on-line to initialize the predictive controller. To that end, we combined the use of sampling-based planning, policy learning with generic representations (such as neural networks), and direct optimal control. We first propose an algorithm to simultaneously build a kinodynamic probabilistic roadmap (PRM) and approximate value function and control policy. This algorithm quickly converges toward an approximation of the optimal state-control trajectories (along with an optimal PRM). Then, we propose two methods to store the optimal trajectories and use them to initialize the predictive controller. We experimentally show that directly storing the state-control trajectories leads the predictive controller to quickly converges (2 to 5 iterations) toward the (global) optimal solution. The results are validated in simulation with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and other dynamical systems.},

Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness of the approach to changing environments, outperforming a model-free gradient policy based methods on the same tasks in simulation.

Formulating the jump optimization to allow fast online execution is difficult; efficiently using this capability to generate long-horizon trajectories further complicates the problem. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical planning framework to address this problem. We first formulate a real-time tractable trajectory optimization for performing omnidirectional jumping. We then embed the results of this optimization into a low dimensional jump feasibility classifier. This classifier is leveraged by a high-level planner to produce paths that are both dynamically feasible and also robust to variability in hardware trajectory realizations. We deploy our framework on the Mini Cheetah Vision quadruped, demonstrating robot's ability to generate and execute reliable, goal-oriented paths that involve forward, lateral, and rotational jumps onto surfaces 1.35 times taller than robot's nominal hip height. The ability to plan through omnidirectional jumping greatly expands robot's mobility relative to planners that restrict jumping to the sagittal or frontal planes.},

A parallel decomposition algorithm is developed to iteratively decompose a global task specification into a set of smaller subtask automata. Robots are assigned to the smallest task component in each subtask automaton. The capability transition system of the assigned robots and these subtask automata synthesize a corresponding set of subtask planning automata (SPA), each of which is either an independent satisfaction of an individual subtask automaton or a concurrent satisfaction of multiple subtask automata. The overall robot assignments and SPA can guarantee the MRS to satisfy all the subtask automata. Each SPA can generate a minimal cost task plan by taking into account the costs of multi-robot tasking. The robots then plan motions to execute the tasks associated with the minimal cost task plans. The proposed framework is demonstrated with a multi-robot experiment for manufacturing tasks in a lab setting. Extensive numerical simulations are also performed to evaluate the scalability, computational complexity, and execution efficiency of the proposed framework and show its advantages over the centralized task and motion planning strategy.},

	abstract = {Dynamic quadruped locomotion over challenging terrains with precise foot placements is a hard problem for both optimal control methods and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Non-linear solvers can produce coordinated constraint satisfying motions, but often take too long to converge for online application. RL methods can learn dynamic reactive controllers but require carefully tuned shaping rewards to produce good gaits and can have trouble discovering precise coordinated movements. Imitation learning circumvents this problem and has been used with motion capture data to extract quadruped gaits for flat terrains. However, it would be costly to acquire motion capture data for a very large variety of terrains with height differences. In this work, we combine the advantages of trajectory optimization and learning methods and show that terrain adaptive controllers can be obtained by training policies to imitate trajectories that have been planned over procedural terrains by a non-linear solver. We show that the learned policies transfer to unseen terrains and can be fine-tuned to dynamically traverse challenging terrains that require precise foot placements and are very hard to solve with standard RL.},

	abstract = {Quadrupeds are strong candidates for navigating challenging environments because of their agile and dynamic designs. This paper presents a methodology that extends the range of exploration for quadrupedal robots by creating an end-to-end navigation framework that exploits walking and jumping modes. To obtain a dynamic jumping maneuver while avoiding obstacles, dynamically-feasible trajectories are optimized offline through collocation-based optimization where safety constraints are imposed. Such optimization schematic allows the robot to jump through window-shaped obstacles by considering both obstacles in the air and on the ground. The resulted jumping mode is utilized in an autonomous navigation pipeline that leverages a search-based global planner and a local planner to enable the robot to reach the goal location by walking. A state machine together with a decision making strategy allows the system to switch behaviors between walking around obstacles or jumping through them. The proposed framework is experimentally deployed and validated on a quadrupedal robot, a Mini Cheetah, to enable the robot to autonomously navigate through an environment while avoiding obstacles and jumping over a maximum height of 13 cm to pass through a window-shaped opening in order to reach its goal.

Navigating discrete terrain is challenging for quadrupeds because the motion of the robot can be aperiodic, highly dynamic, and blind for the hind legs of the robot. Additionally, the robot needs to reason over both the feasible footholds as well as robot velocity by speeding up and slowing down at different parts of the terrain. We build an offline library of periodic gaits which span two trotting steps on the robot, and switch between different motion primitives to achieve aperiodic motions of different step lengths on an A1 robot. The motion library is used to provide targets to a geometric model predictive controller which controls stance. To incorporate visual feedback, we use terrain mapping tools to build a local height map of the terrain around the robot using RGB and depth cameras, and extract feasible foothold locations around both the front and hind legs of the robot. Our experiments show a Unitree A1 robot navigating multiple unknown, challenging and discrete terrains in the real world.},

	abstract = {Animal-level agility and robustness in robots cannot be accomplished by solely relying on blind locomotion controllers. A significant portion of a robot's ability to traverse terrain comes from reacting to the external world through visual sensing. However, embedding the sensors and compute that provide sufficient accuracy at high speeds is challenging, especially if the robot has significant space limitations. In this paper, we propose a system integration of a small-scale quadruped robot, the MIT Mini-Cheetah Vision, that exteroceptively senses the terrain and dynamically explores the world around it at high velocities. Through extensive hardware and software development, we demonstrate a fully untethered robot with all hardware onboard running a locomotion controller that combines state-of-the-art Regularized Predictive Control (RPC) with Whole-Body Impulse Control (WBIC). We devise a hierarchical state estimator that integrates kinematic, IMU, and localization sensor data to provide state estimates specific to path planning and locomotion tasks. Our integrated system has demonstrated robust autonomous waypoint tracking in dynamic real-world environments at speeds of over 1 m/s with high rates of success.},

	abstract = {Solving an optimal control or estimation problem is not easy. Pieces of the puzzle are found scattered throughout many different disciplines. Furthermore, the focus of this book is on practical methods, that is, methods that I have found actually work! In fact everything described in this book has been implemented in production software and used to solve real optimal control problems. Although the reader should be proficient in advanced mathematics, no theorems are presented. Traditionally, there are two major parts of a successful optimal control or optimal estimation solution technique. The first part is the “optimization” method. The second part is the “differential equation” method. When faced with an optimal control or estimation problem it is tempting to simply “paste” together packages for optimization and numerical integration. While naive approaches such as this may be moderately successful, the goal of this book is to suggest that there is a better way! The methods used to solve the differential equations and optimize the functions are intimately related. The first two chapters of this book focus on the optimization part of the problem. In Chapter 1 the important concepts of nonlinear programming for small dense applications are introduced. Chapter 2 extends the presentation to problems which are both large and sparse. Chapters 3 and 4 address the differential equation part of the problem. Chapter 3 introduces relevant material in the numerical solution of differential (and differentialalgebraic) equations. Methods for solving the optimal control problem are treated in some detail in Chapter 4. Throughout the book the interaction between optimization and integration is emphasized. Chapter 5 describes how to solve optimal estimation problems. Chapter 6 presents a collection of examples that illustrate the various concepts and techniques. Real world problems often require solving a sequence of optimal control and/or optimization problems, and Chapter 7 describes a collection of these “advanced applications.” While the book incorporates a great deal of new material not covered in Practical Methods for Optimal Control Using Nonlinear Programming [21], it does not cover everything. Many important topics are simply not discussed in order to keep the overall presentation concise and focused. The discussion is general and presents a unified approach to solving optimal estimation and control problems. Most of the examples are drawn from my experience in the aerospace industry. Examples have been solved using a particular implementation called  SOCS.SOCS.{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater} {\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="double-struck"{\textgreater}SOCS{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}.{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater}  I have tried to adhere to notational conventions from both optimization and control theory whenever possible.

	abstract = {Machine learning has long since become a keystone technology, accelerating science and applications in a broad range of domains. Consequently, the notion of applying learning methods to a particular problem set has become an established and valuable modus operandi to advance a particular field. In this article we argue that such an approach does not straightforwardly extended to robotics -- or to embodied intelligence more generally: systems which engage in a purposeful exchange of energy and information with a physical environment. In particular, the purview of embodied intelligent agents extends significantly beyond the typical considerations of main-stream machine learning approaches, which typically (i) do not consider operation under conditions significantly different from those encountered during training; (ii) do not consider the often substantial, long-lasting and potentially safety-critical nature of interactions during learning and deployment; (iii) do not require ready adaptation to novel tasks while at the same time (iv) effectively and efficiently curating and extending their models of the world through targeted and deliberate actions. In reality, therefore, these limitations result in learning-based systems which suffer from many of the same operational shortcomings as more traditional, engineering-based approaches when deployed on a robot outside a well defined, and often narrow operating envelope. Contrary to viewing embodied intelligence as another application domain for machine learning, here we argue that it is in fact a key driver for the advancement of machine learning technology. In this article our goal is to highlight challenges and opportunities that are specific to embodied intelligence and to propose research directions which may significantly advance the state-of-the-art in robot learning.},

We leverage this representation to improve long-term locomotion plans in terms of success rates, path costs and reasoning about which gait-controller to use when. We show that NavMeshes have higher planning success rates than sampling-based planners, but are 400x faster to construct and at least 100x faster to plan with. The performance gap further increases when considering multi-floor environments. We present both a procedure for building controller-aware NavMeshes and a full navigation system that adapts to changes to the environment.

We assume that each robot has its individual task specification and the robots have to jointly satisfy a global collaborative task specification, both described in linear temporal logic. Specifically, a central server firstly extracts and decomposes a collaborative task sequence from the automaton corresponding to the collaborative task specification, and allocates the subtasks in the sequence to robots. The robots can then synthesize their initial execution strategies based on locally constructed product automatons, combining the assigned collaborative tasks and their individual task specifications. Furthermore, we propose a distributed execution strategy adjusting mechanism to iteratively improve the time efficiency, by reducing wait time in collaborations caused by potential synchronization constraints. We prove the completeness of the proposed framework under assumptions, and analyze its time complexity and optimality.

The motion generation and motion execution algorithms are connected through the Free Gait API. This facilitates the development and execution of higher level behaviors and motion planning algorithms. The API is structured to accommodate a variety of task-space control commands. With these, the framework is applicable to intuitive tele-operation of the robot, scripting of user deﬁned behaviors, and fully autonomous operation with motion planners. The deﬁned motion plans are tracked with a feedback whole-body controller to ensure accurate and robust motion execution. We use Free Gait with our quadrupedal robot ANYmal and present results for rough terrain climbing, whole-body stair scaling, and special motions such as push-ups and squad jumps.

Our method adjusts the landing position of the feet in a fully reactive manner, using only on-board computers and sensors. The correction is computed and executed continuously along the swing phase trajectory of each leg. To efficiently adapt the landing position, we implement a self-supervised foothold classifier based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our method results in an up to 200 times faster computation with respect to the full-blown heuristics. Our goal is to react to visual stimuli from the environment, bridging the gap between blind reactive locomotion and purely vision-based planning strategies.

The main goal is to relax the fixed center of mass (CoM) height assumption of the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM) and generate a wider range of walking and running motions, without a considerable increase in complexity. To do so, we use the concept of virtual constraints in the centroidal space which enables generating motions beyond walking while keeping the complexity at a minimum. By a proper choice of these virtual constraints, we show that we can generate different types of walking and running motions. More importantly, enforcing the virtual constraints through feedback renders the dynamics linear and enables us to design a feedback control mechanism which adapts the next step location and timing in face of disturbances, through a simple quadratic program (QP). To show the effectiveness of this framework, we showcase different walking and running simulations of the biped robot Bolt in the presence of both environmental uncertainties and external disturbances.},

The solution of this module is then used to formulate a whole-body trajectory optimization based on the full nonlinear dynamics of the robot. This combination allows us to effectively optimize for contact timings while guaranteeing the accuracy of the jumping trajectory that can be realized in the hardware. We validate the efficiency of the proposed framework on the A1 robot model for various 3D jumping tasks such as double-backflips and double barrel roll off the high altitude of 2m and 0.8m respectively.

Motions are planned via a centroidal momentum-based nonlinear optimization that is general enough to produce rich sets of novel dynamic motions based solely on the user-specified contact schedule and desired launch velocity of the robot. Since this nonlinear optimization is not tractable for real-time receding horizon control, motions are planned once via nonlinear optimization in preparation of an aerial motion and then tracked continuously using a variational-based optimal controller that offers robustness to the uncertainties that exist in the real hardware such as modeling error or disturbances. Motion planning typically takes between 0.05-0.15 seconds, while the optimal controller finds stabilizing feedback inputs at 500 Hz. Experimental results on the MIT Mini Cheetah demonstrate that the framework can reliably produce successful aerial motions such as jumps onto and off of platforms, spins, flips, barrel rolls, and running jumps over obstacles.},

Reinforcement learning presents an appealing approach for automating the controller design process and has been able to produce remarkably robust controllers when trained in a suitable range of environments. However, it is difficult to predict all likely conditions the robot will encounter during deployment and enumerate them at training-time. What if instead of training controllers that are robust enough to handle any eventuality, we enable the robot to continually learn in any setting it finds itself in? This kind of real-world reinforcement learning poses a number of challenges, including efficiency, safety, and autonomy. To address these challenges, we propose a practical robot reinforcement learning system for fine-tuning locomotion policies in the real world. We demonstrate that a modest amount of real-world training can substantially improve performance during deployment, and this enables a real A1 quadrupedal robot to autonomously fine-tune multiple locomotion skills in a range of environments, including an outdoor lawn and a variety of indoor terrains.},

	title = {Balance control and locomotion planning for humanoid robots using nonlinear centroidal models},
	abstract = {Balance control approaches for humanoid robots have traditionally relied on lowdimensional models for locomotion planning and reactive balance control. Results for the low-dimensional model are mapped to the full robot, and used as inputs to a whole-body controller. In particular, the linear inverted pendulum (LIP) has long been the de facto standard low-dimensional model used in balance control. The LIP has its limitations, however. For example, it requires that the robot’s center of mass move on a plane and that the robot’s contact environment be planar. This thesis presents control and planning approaches using nonlinear low-dimensional models, aimed at mitigating some of the limitations of the LIP. Speciﬁcally, the contributions are: 1) a closed-form controller and region of attraction analysis for a nonlinear variable-height inverted pendulum model, 2) a trajectory optimization approach for humanoid robot locomotion over moderately complex terrain based on mixedinteger nonlinear programming with a low-dimensional model, and 3) a quadraticprogramming based controller that uses the the results from these low-dimensional models to control a simulation model of the Atlas humanoid robot.},

	abstract = {To achieve highly dynamic jumps of legged robots, it is essential to control the rotational dynamics of the robot. In this paper, we aim to improve the jumping performance by proposing a unified model for planning highly dynamic jumps that can approximately model the centroidal inertia. This model abstracts the robot as a single rigid body for the base and point masses for the legs. The model is called the Lump Leg Single Rigid Body Model (LL-SRBM) and can be used to plan motions for both bipedal and quadrupedal robots. By taking the effects of leg dynamics into account, LL-SRBM provides a computationally efficient way for the motion planner to change the centroidal inertia of the robot with various leg configurations. Concurrently, we propose a novel contact detection method by using the norm of the average spatial velocity. After the contact is detected, the controller is switched to force control to achieve a soft landing. Twisting jump and forward jump experiments on the bipedal robot SLIDER and quadrupedal robot ANYmal demonstrate the improved jump performance by actively changing the centroidal inertia. These experiments also show the generalization and the robustness of the integrated planning and control framework.},

	abstract = {Trajectory optimization has been used extensively in robotic systems. In particular, Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) has performed well as an off-line planner or an online nonlinear model predictive control solver, with a lower computational cost compared with other general-purpose nonlinear programming solvers. However, standard DDP cannot handle any constraints or perform reasonable initialization of a state trajectory. In this paper, we propose a hybrid constrained DDP variant with a multiple-shooting framework. The main technical contributions are twofold: 1) In addition to inheriting the simplicity of the initialization in multiple shooting, a two-stage framework is developed to deal with state and control inequality constraints robustly without loss of the linear feedback term of DDP. Such a hybrid strategy offers a fast convergence of constraint satisfaction. 2) An improved globalization strategy is proposed to exploit the coupled effects between line-searching and regularization, which is able to enhance the numerical robustness of DDP-like approaches. Our approach is tested on three constrained trajectory optimization problems with nonlinear inequality constraints and outperforms the commonly-used collocation and shooting methods in terms of runtime and constraint satisfaction.},

However, a na\${\textbackslash}"i\$ve implementation of NLP algorithms, e.g., shooting-based sequential quadratic programming (SQP), may suffer from slow convergence -- caused from natural instabilities of the underlying system manifesting as poor numerical stability within the optimization. Re-interpreting the DDP closed-loop rollout policy as a sensitivity-based correction to a second-order search direction, we demonstrate how to compute analogous closed-loop policies (i.e., feedback gains) for constrained problems. Our key theoretical result introduces a novel dynamic programming-based constraint-set recursion that augments the canonical "cost-to-go" backward pass. On the algorithmic front, we develop a hybrid-SQP algorithm incorporating DDP-style closed-loop rollouts, enabled via efficient parallelized computation of the feedback gains. Finally, we validate our theoretical and algorithmic contributions on a set of increasingly challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in convergence speed over standard open-loop SQP.},

	abstract = {We propose a locomotion framework for bipedal robots consisting of a new motion planning method, dubbed trajectory optimization for walking robots plus (TOWR+), and a new whole-body control method, dubbed implicit hierarchical whole-body controller (IHWBC). For versatility, we consider the use of a composite rigid body (CRB) model to optimize the robot’s walking behavior. The proposed CRB model considers the floating base dynamics while accounting for the effects of the heavy distal mass of humanoids using a pre-trained centroidal inertia network. TOWR+ leverages the phase-based parameterization of its precursor, TOWR, and optimizes for base and end-effectors motions, feet contact wrenches, as well as contact timing and locations without the need to solve a complementary problem or integer program. The use of IHWBC enforces unilateral contact constraints (i.e., non-slip and non-penetration constraints) and a task hierarchy through the cost function, relaxing contact constraints and providing an implicit hierarchy between tasks. This controller provides additional flexibility and smooth task and contact transitions as applied to our 10 degree-of-freedom, line-feet biped robot DRACO. In addition, we introduce a new open-source and light-weight software architecture, dubbed planning and control (PnC), that implements and combines TOWR+ and IHWBC. PnC provides modularity, versatility, and scalability so that the provided modules can be interchanged with other motion planners and whole-body controllers and tested in an end-to-end manner. In the experimental section, we first analyze the performance of TOWR+ using various bipeds. We then demonstrate balancing behaviors on the DRACO hardware using the proposed IHWBC method. Finally, we integrate TOWR+ and IHWBC and demonstrate step-and-stop behaviors on the DRACO hardware.},

While manually-designed controllers have been able to emulate many complex behaviors, building such controllers involves a time-consuming and difficult development process, often requiring substantial expertise of the nuances of each skill. Reinforcement learning provides an appealing alternative for automating the manual effort involved in the development of controllers. However, designing learning objectives that elicit the desired behaviors from an agent can also require a great deal of skill-specific expertise. In this work, we present an imitation learning system that enables legged robots to learn agile locomotion skills by imitating real-world animals. We show that by leveraging reference motion data, a single learning-based approach is able to automatically synthesize controllers for a diverse repertoire behaviors for legged robots. By incorporating sample efficient domain adaptation techniques into the training process, our system is able to learn adaptive policies in simulation that can then be quickly adapted for real-world deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we train an 18-DoF quadruped robot to perform a variety of agile behaviors ranging from different locomotion gaits to dynamic hops and turns.},

Our contribution lies in exploiting the structure of the dynamics in order to simplify the original non-convex problem into two convex subproblems. We iterate between these two subproblems for a set number of iterations or until a consensus is reached. We explore the properties of the proposed optimization method for the centroidal dynamics and verify in simulation that motions generated by our approach can be tracked by the quadruped Solo12. In addition, we compare our method to a recently proposed convexification using a sequence of convex relaxations as well as a more standard interior point method used in the off- the-shelf solver IPOPT to show that our approach finds similar, if not better, trajectories (in terms of cost), and is more than four times faster than both approaches. Finally, compared to previous approaches, we note its practicality due to the convex nature of each subproblem which allows our method to be used with any off-the-shelf quadratic programming solver.},

By approximating the product automaton by a tree rather than representing it explicitly, we require much fewer memory resources to store it and motion plans can be found by tracing sequences of parent nodes without the need for sophisticated graph search methods. This significantly increases the scalability of our algorithm compared to existing optimal control synthesis methods. We also show that the proposed algorithm is probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal.

Compared to linearized models used in iLQR, DDP more accurately represents the dynamics locally, but it is not often used since the second-order derivatives of the dynamics are tensorial and expensive to compute. This work shows how to avoid the need for computing the derivative tensor by instead leveraging reverse-mode accumulation of derivative information to compute a key vector-tensor product directly. We also show how the structure of the dynamics can be used to further accelerate these computations in rigid-body systems. Benchmarks of this approach for trajectory optimization with multi-link manipulators show that the benefits of DDP can often be included without sacrificing evaluation time, and can be done in fewer iterations than iLQR.},

	abstract = {When traversing uneven terrain, humans consider their future steps for choosing the best location and timing of their current step. Likewise, when planning multi-contact motions for legged robots (e.g. humanoids), a 'prediction horizon' has to be considered. However, planning several steps ahead increases the dimensionality and non-linearity of an already challenging problem, which makes online planning intractable. We propose to reduce the problem complexity by using convex relaxations in the prediction horizon. We realize this idea within a Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) framework to plan dynamically consistent centroidal trajectories of humanoid walking on uneven terrain. This results in a novel formulation that combines an accurate non-convex model with a relaxed convex model, which we call RHP with multiple levels of model fidelity. We evaluate three candidate multi-fidelity RHPs with convex relaxations of the centroidal dynamics in the prediction horizon. The best candidate is 1.4x-3.0x (average 2.4x) faster than the traditional RHP that employs a single dynamics model over the entire look-ahead horizon. We also validate the resultant centroidal trajectories by tracking them with a whole-body inverse dynamics controller in simulation. Lastly, we find that incorporating angular dynamics in the prediction horizon is important to the success of multi-fidelity RHP.},

	url = {http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-251666},
	abstract = {With the increase of robotic presence in our homes and work environment, it has become imperative to consider human-in-the-loop systems when designing robotic controllers. This includes both a physical presence of humans as well as interaction on a decision and control level. One important aspect of this is to design controllers which are guaranteed to satisfy specified safety constraints. At the same time we must minimize the risk of not finding solutions, which would force the system to stop. This require some room for relaxation to be put on the specifications. Another aspect is to design the system to be adaptive to the human and its environment. In this thesis we approach the problem by considering control synthesis for multi-agent systems under hard and soft constraints, where the human has direct impact on how the soft constraint is violated. To handle the multi-agent structure we consider both a classical centralized automata based framework and a decentralized approach with collision avoidance. To handle soft constraints we introduce a novel metric; hybrid distance, which quantify the violation. The hybrid distance consists of two types of violation; continuous distance or missing deadlines, and discrete distance or spacial violation. These distances are weighed against each other with a weight constant we will denote as the human preference constant. For the human impact we consider two types of feedback; direct feedback on the violation in the form of determining the human preference constant, and direct control input through mixed-initiative control where the human preference constant is determined through an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm based on the suggested and followed paths. The methods are validated through simulations. I takt med att robotar blir allt vanligare i våra hem och i våra arbetsmiljöer, har det blivit allt viktigare att ta hänsyn till människan plats i systemen när regulatorerna för robotorna designas. Detta innefattar både människans fysiska närvaro och interaktion på besluts- och reglernivå. En viktig aspekt i detta är att designa regulatorer som garanterat uppfyller givna villkor. Samtidigt måste vi minimera risken att ingen lösning hittas, eftersom det skulle tvinga systemet till ett stopp. För att uppnå detta krävs det att det finns rum för att mjuka upp villkoren. En annan aspekt är att designa systemet så att det är anpassningsbart till människan och miljön. I den här uppsatsen närmar vi oss problemet genom att använda regulator syntes för multi-agent system under hårda och mjuka villkor där människan har direkt påverkan på hur det svaga villkoret överträds. För att hantera multi-agent strukturen undersöker vi både det klassiska centraliserade automata-baserade ramverket och ett icke-centraliserat tillvägagångsätt med krockundvikning. För att hantera mjuka villkor introducerar vi en metrik; hybrida avståndet, som kvantifierar överträdelsen. Det hybrida avståndet består av två typer av överträdelse (kontinuerligt avstånd eller missandet av deadlines, och diskret avstånd eller rumsliga överträdelser) som vägs mot varandra med en vikt konstant som vi kommer att kalla den mänskliga preferens kontanten. Som mänsklig påverkan överväger vi direkt feedback på överträdelsen genom att hon bestämmer värdet på den mänskliga preferens kontanten, och direkt påverkan på regulatorn där den mänskliga preferens konstanten bestäms genom en inverserad förstärkt inlärnings algoritm baserad på de föreslagna och följda vägarna. Metoderna valideras genom simuleringar.},

When the robots can follow a given trajectory exactly, our method computes a set of optimal satisfying paths that minimize the cost function and satisfy the LTL formula. However, if the traveling times of the robots are uncertain, then the robots may not be able to follow a given trajectory exactly, possibly violating the LTL formula during deployment.

The state-of-the-art approach to this problem employs the automata-theoretic model checking technique to solve this problem. This approach involves computation of a product graph of the Buchi automaton generated from the LTL specification and a joint transition system which captures the collective motion of the robots and then computation of the shortest path using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. We propose MT*, an algorithm that reduces the computation burden for generating such plans for multi-robot systems significantly. Our approach generates a reduced version of the product graph without computing the complete joint transition system, which is computationally expensive. It then divides the complete mission specification among the participating robots and generates the trajectories for the individual robots independently. Our approach demonstrates substantial speedup in terms of computation time over the state-of-the-art approach, and unlike the state of the art approach, scales well with both the number of robots and the size of the workspace},

We present tasks of increasing complexity leading to a combination of three-dimensional (re-)orientation and landing locomotion behaviors of a quadruped robot traversing simulated low-gravity celestial bodies. We show that our approach easily generalizes across these tasks and successfully trains policies for each case.

Our approach is based on recent advances in stochastic optimization algorithms for optimal trajectory generation. These methods rely on estimation of the rare event of sampling optimal trajectories, which is achieved by incrementally improving a sampling distribution so as to minimize the cross-entropy. A key component of these stochastic optimization algorithms is determining whether or not a trajectory is collision-free. We generalize this collision checking to eﬃciently verify whether or not a trajectory satisﬁes a LTL formula. Interestingly, this veriﬁcation can be done in time polynomial in the length of the LTL formula and the trajectory. We also propose a method for eﬃciently re-using parts of trajectories that only partially satisfy the speciﬁcation, instead of simply discarding the entire sample. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments involving Dubins car and a generic point-mass model subject to complex temporal logic task speciﬁcations.},

Both the robot and the environment are subjected to behavioral specifications expressed as an assume-guarantee linear temporal logic (LTL) formula. We then consider how to efficiently modify the synthesized controller when the robot encounters unexpected changes in its environment. The crucial insight is that a portion of this problem takes place in a metric space, which provides a notion of nearness. Thus if a nominal plan fails, we need not resynthesize it entirely, but instead can “patch” it locally. We present an algorithm for doing this, prove soundness (correctness of output), and demonstrate it on an example gridworld.},

Existing planning approaches with temporal logic specifications rely on graph search techniques applied to a product automaton constructed among the robots. In our previous work, we have proposed a more tractable sampling-based algorithm that builds incrementally trees that approximate the state space and transitions of the synchronous product automaton and does not require sophisticated graph search techniques. Here, we extend our previous work by introducing bias in the sampling process that is guided by transitions in the Büchi automaton that belong to the shortest path to the accepting states. This allows us to synthesize optimal motion plans from product automata with hundreds of orders of magnitude more states than those that existing optimal control synthesis methods or off-the-shelf model checkers can manipulate. We show that STyLuS* is probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal and has exponential convergence rate. This is the first time that convergence rate results are provided for sampling-based optimal control synthesis methods. We provide simulation results that show that STyLuS* can synthesize optimal motion plans for very large multi-robot systems, which is impossible using state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {In service robot applications, planning is often integrated with task allocation. Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) as an expressive high-level formalism is widely used for task specification, and allows for formalised restrictions on temporal sequences of tasks. In multiagent planning, a Multi-Objective Markov Decision Process extends the standard model with vector rewards capturing possibly conflicting planning objectives. Such objectives include the success rates of accomplishing individual tasks, and the cost budgets for individual agents. In this paper, we consider the problem of concurrently allocating LTL task sequences to a team of agents and calculating optimal task schedulers simultaneously, satisfying cost and probability thresholds. We reduce this problem to multi-objective scheduler synthesis for a team MDP structure, whose size is linear in the number of agents.

Based on the knowledge update, each agent verifies and revises its motion plan in real time.

	abstract = {Robotic assembly planning has the potential to profoundly change how buildings can be designed and created. It enables architects to explicitly account for the assembly process already during the design phase, and enables efficient building methods that profit from the robots' different capabilities. Previous work has addressed planning of robot assembly sequences and identifying the feasibility of architectural designs. This paper extends previous work by enabling assembly planning with large, heterogeneous teams of robots. We present a scalable planning system which enables parallelization of complex task and motion planning problems by iteratively solving smaller sub-problems. Combining optimization methods to solve for manipulation constraints with a sampling-based bi-directional space-time path planner enables us to plan cooperative multi-robot manipulation with unknown arrival-times. Thus, our solver allows for completing sub-problems and tasks with differing timescales and synchronizes them effectively. We demonstrate the approach on multiple case-studies and on two long-horizon building assembly scenarios to show the robustness and scalability of our algorithm.},

The proposed approach optimally allocates separable tasks to available robots, without requiring a priori an explicit representation of the tasks or the computation of all task execution costs. Instead, we propose an approach for identifying sub-tasks in an automaton representation of the mission specification and for simultaneously allocating the tasks and planning their execution. The proposed framework avoids the need to compute a combinatorial number of possible assignment costs, where each computation itself requires solving a complex planning problem. This can improve computational efficiency compared with classical assignment solutions, in particular for on-demand missions where task costs are unknown in advance. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach with multiple robots in an existing office environment and evaluate its performance in several case study scenarios.},

However, controlling robots to perform complex tasks is still accomplished largely by highly trained programmers in a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process that is typically validated only through extensive testing. Formal methods are mathematical techniques for reasoning about systems, their requirements, and their guarantees. Formal synthesis for robotics refers to frameworks for specifying tasks in a mathematically precise language and automatically transforming these specifications into correct-by-construction robot controllers or into a proof that the task cannot be done. Synthesis allows users to reason about the task specification rather than its implementation, reduces implementation error, and provides behavioral guarantees for the resulting controller.

In addition, our framework explicitly captures sensor specifications that depend on the environment with which the robot is interacting, which results in a novel paradigm for sensor-based temporal-logic-motion planning. As one robot is part of the environment of another robot, our sensor-based framework very naturally captures multirobot specifications in a decentralized manner. Our computational approach is based on first creating discrete controllers satisfying specific LTL formulas. If feasible, the discrete controller is then used to guide the sensor-based composition of continuous controllers, which results in a hybrid controller satisfying the high-level specification but only if the environment is admissible.},

	abstract = {Behavior Trees (BTs) were invented as a tool to enable modular AI in computer games, but have received an increasing amount of attention in the robotics community in the last decade. With rising demands on agent AI complexity, game programmers found that the Finite State Machines (FSM) that they used scaled poorly and were difficult to extend, adapt and reuse. In BTs, the state transition logic is not dispersed across the individual states, but organized in a hierarchical tree structure, with the states as leaves. This has a significant effect on modularity, which in turn simplifies both synthesis and analysis by humans and algorithms alike. These advantages are needed not only in game AI design, but also in robotics, as is evident from the research being done. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of the topic of BTs in Artificial Intelligence and Robotic applications. The existing literature is described and categorized based on methods, application areas and contributions, and the paper is concluded with a list of open research challenges.},

Moreover, special attention is given to the interaction between the task and motion levels, where we use behavior tree as an intermediate interface to execute the plan, feedback the execution outcome and facilitate the high-level task re-planning process.

We also decompose the global surveillance speciﬁcation into local speciﬁcations for each sensor, and show that if the sensors satisfy their local surveillance speciﬁcations, then the sensor network as a whole will satisfy the global surveillance objective. Thus, our method is able to guarantee global surveillance properties in a mobile sensor network while synthesizing completely decentralized strategies with no need for coordination between the sensors.

The tasks are encoded as constraints in an energy minimization problem solved at each point in time by each robot. The prioritization of a task over others—effectively signifying the allocation of the task to that particular robot—occurs via the introduction of slack variables in the task constraints. Moreover, the suitabilities of certain robots towards certain tasks are also taken into account to generate a task allocation algorithm for a team of robots with heterogeneous capabilities. The efﬁcacy of the developed approach is demonstrated both in simulation and on a team of real robots.},

The proposed approach builds on recent advances in Reactive Mission Planning using Linear Temporal Logic, and Local Motion Planning using convex optimization. A local planner enforces the dynamic constraints of the robot and guarantees collision avoidance in 2D and 3D workspaces. A reactive mission planner takes a high-level speciﬁcation that captures complex motion sequencing, and generates a correct-by-construction controller guaranteed to achieve the speciﬁed behavior and be reactive to sensor events. If there is no controller that fulﬁlls the speciﬁcation because of possible deadlock in the the local planner, a minimal set of human-readable assumptions is generated as a certiﬁcate of the conditions on deadlock where the task is guaranteed. This is truly a synergistic method: the low-level motion planner enables scalability of the high-level plan synthesis with respect to dynamic obstacles, and the high-level mission planner enforces correctness of the low-level motion. We provide formal guarantees for our approach and demonstrate it via physical experiments with ground robots and simulations with a team of quadrotors.},

The approach we take is to decompose both the temporal logic specification and the team of agents. We jointly reason about the assignment of agents to subteams and the decomposition of formulas using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) approach. The output of the SMT is then distributed to subteams and leads to a significant speed up in planning time.

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of optimally allocating tasks, expressed as global Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications, to teams of heterogeneous mobile robots. The robots are classified in different types that capture their different capabilities, and each task may require robots of multiple types. The specific robots assigned to each task are immaterial, as long as they are of the desired type. Given a discrete workspace, our goal is to design paths, i.e., sequences of discrete states, for the robots so that the LTL specification is satisfied. To obtain a scalable solution to this complex temporal logic task allocation problem, we propose a hierarchical approach that first allocates specific robots to tasks using the information about the tasks contained in the Nondeterministic Buchi Automaton (NBA) that captures the LTL specification, and then designs low-level executable plans for the robots that respect the high-level assignment. Specifically, we first prune and relax the NBA by removing all negative atomic propositions. This step is motivated by "lazy collision checking" methods in robotics and allows to simplify the planning problem by checking constraint satisfaction only when needed. Then, we extract sequences of subtasks from the relaxed NBA along with their temporal orders, and formulate a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to allocate these subtasks to the robots. Finally, we define generalized multi-robot path planning problems to obtain low-level executable robot plans that satisfy both the high-level task allocation and the temporal constraints captured by the negative atomic propositions in the original NBA. We provide theoretical results showing completeness and soundness of our proposed method and present numerical simulations demonstrating that our method can generate robot paths with lower cost, considerably faster than existing methods.},

	abstract = {Existing approaches for coordinating teams of heterogeneous agents either consider small numbers of agents, are application-speciﬁc solutions, or do not adequately address requirements, e.g., deadlines or inter-task dependencies, common to real-world applications. We develop a framework called Scalable and Robust Algorithms for Task-based Coordination from High-level Speciﬁcations (ScRATCHS) to coordinate such teams. We deﬁne a speciﬁcation language, called capability temporal logic (CaTL), to describe rich, temporal properties involving tasks requiring the participation of multiple agents with multiple capabilities, e.g., sensors or end effectors. An example speciﬁcation is “Ensure at least 10 airborne cameras and 3 airborne lidars are surveying Site A for at least 15 minutes simultaneously during every hour-long period. Make sure that 5 cameras are always observing Site B. Send 10 lidars to Site B within 3 hours of deployment and remain there until 4 ground vehicles with infrared sensors arrive 2 hours later.” Arbitrary missions and team dynamics are jointly encoded as constraints in a mixed integer linear program (MILP), which can be solved efﬁciently using commercial off-the-shelf solvers. ScRATCHS also enables optimization of the resulting plan to be maximally robust to agent attrition at the penalty of increased computation time. The ﬂexible speciﬁcation language, fast solution time, and optional robustness of ScRATCHS provide a ﬁrst step towards a multi-purpose on-the-ﬂy planning tool for a supervisor tasking large teams with multiple capabilities enacting missions with multiple tasks. We validate our approach using randomized computational experiments and via a hardware demonstration.},

Finite-state approximations that abstract the behavior of the underlying continuous dynamics are defined using finite transition systems. Such approximations allow us to transform the continuous switching synthesis problem into a discrete synthesis problem in the form of a two-player game between the system and the environment, where the winning conditions represent the high-level temporal logic specifications. Restricting to an expressive subclass of LTL formulas, these temporal logic games are amenable to solutions with polynomial-time complexity. By construction, existence of a discrete switching strategy for the discrete synthesis problem guarantees the existence of a switching protocol that can be implemented at the continuous level to ensure the correctness of the nonlinear switched system and to react to the environment at run time.},

In this letter we present a new mathematical framework in which we formally express Behavior Trees in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show how this framework equivalently represents classical BTs. Then we utilize the proposed framework to construct an algorithm to verify that a given BT satisfies a given LTL specification. We prove that this algorithm is sound. Importantly, we prove that this method does not compromise the flexible design process of BTs, i.e. changes to subtrees can be verified separately and their combination can be assured to be correct. We present an example of the proposed algorithm in use.},

	abstract = {New uses of robotics in traditionally manual manufacturing processes require the careful choreography of human and robotic agents to support safe and efﬁcient coordinated work. Tasks must be allocated among agents and scheduled to meet temporal deadlines and spatial restrictions on agent proximity. These systems must also be capable of replanning onthe-ﬂy to adapt to disturbances in the schedule and to respond to people working in close physical proximity. In this paper, we present a centralized algorithm, named Tercio, that handles tightly intercoupled temporal and spatial constraints and scales to larger problem sizes than prior art. Our key innovation is a fast, satisﬁcing multi-agent task sequencer that is inspired by real-time processor scheduling techniques but is adapted to leverage hierarchical problem structure. We use this fast task sequencer in conjunction with a MILP solver, and show that we are able to generate near-optimal task assignments and schedules for up to 10 agents and 500 tasks in less than 20 seconds on average. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithm in a multi-robot hardware testbed.},

The features and complexity of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problems are dictated by the requirements of the particular domain under consideration. These problems can range from those involving instantaneous distribution of simple, independent tasks among members of a homogenous team, to those requiring the time-extended scheduling of complex interrelated multi-step tasks for members of a heterogenous team related by several constraints. The existing widely used taxonomy for task allocation in multi-robot systems was designed for problems with independent tasks and does not deal with problems with interrelated utilities and constraints. While that taxonomy was a ground-breaking contribution to the MRTA literature, a survey of recent work in MRTA reveals that it is no longer a sufficient taxonomy, due to the increasing importance of interrelated utilities and constraints in realistic MRTA problems under consideration. Thus, in this paper, we present a new, comprehensive taxonomy, iTax, that explicitly takes into consideration the issues of interrelated utilities and constraints. Our taxonomy maps categories of MRTA problems to existing mathematical models from combinatorial optimization and operations research, and hence draws important parallels between robotics and these fields.},

The planning part of the algorithm is based on the idea of back chaining. Starting from a goal condition we iteratively select actions to achieve that goal, and if those actions have unmet preconditions, they are extended with actions to achieve them in the same way. The fact that BTs are inherently modular and reactive makes the proposed solution blend acting and planning in a way that enables the robot to effectively react to external disturbances. If an external agent undoes an action the robot reexecutes it without re-planning, and if an external agent helps the robot, it skips the corresponding actions, again without replanning. We illustrate our approach in two different robotics scenarios.},

Furthermore, we improve performance by identifying and taking advantage of the opportunities of parallel task execution, that are present in the single robot BT. Analyzing the proposed approach, we present results regarding how mission performance is affected by minor faults (a robot losing one capability) as well as major faults (a robot losing all its capabilities).},

We propose a framework which we call Robust Logical-Dynamical Systems (RLDS), which combines the advantages of task representations like behavior trees with theoretical guarantees on performance. RLDS can also be constructed automatically from simple sequential task plans and will still achieve robust, reactive behavior in dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we describe both our proposed framework and a case study on a simple household manipulation task, with examples for how specific pieces can be implemented to achieve robust behavior. Finally, we show how in the context of these manipulation tasks, a combination of an RLDS with planning can achieve better results under adversarial conditions.},

Kinematic and dynamic constraint approximations are computed efficiently and validated with a whole-body trajectory optimization. The algorithm is tested over challenging terrain requiring long planning horizons and dynamic motions in seconds - an order of magnitude faster than existing methods.

	abstract = {Optimization algorithms are increasingly important for the control of rigid-body systems. An essential requirement for these algorithms is the availability of accurate partial derivatives of the equations of motion with respect to the state and control variables. State of the art methods for calculating the derivatives use analytical differentiation methods based on the chain rule, and although these methods are an improvement over finite-difference in terms of accuracy, they are not always the most efficient. In this paper, we present an analytical method for calculating the first-order partial derivatives of rigid-body dynamics. The method uses Featherstone's spatial vector algebra and is presented in a recursive form similar to the Recursive-Newton Euler Algorithm (RNEA). Several dynamics identities and computational options are exploited for efficiency. The algorithms are bench-marked against competing approaches in Fortran and C++. Timing results are presented for kinematic trees with up to 500 links. As an example, the 100 link case leads to a 7x speedup over our Fortran implementation of the existing state-of-the-art method. Preliminary comparison of compute timings for the partial derivatives of inverse dynamics in C++ are also shown versus the existing Pinocchio framework. A speedup of 1.6x is reported for the 36-dof ATLAS humanoid using the new algorithm proposed in this paper.},

Starting with an agent that can imitate individual animation clips, we use Generative Adversarial Networks to adapt high-level controls, such as speed and heading, to action distributions that correspond to the original animations. Further fine-tuning through the deep reinforcement learning enables the agent to recover from unseen external perturbations while producing smooth transitions. It then becomes straightforward to create autonomous agents in dynamic environments by adding navigation modules over the entire process. We evaluate our approach by measuring the agent's ability to follow user control and provide a visual analysis of the generated motion to show its effectiveness.},

Their attraction is due in part to the fact that they can represent a general class of methods that allow to learn a solution with a reasonably set reward and minimal prior knowledge, even in situations where it is difficult or expensive for a human expert. For RL to truly make good on this promise, however, we need algorithms and learning setups that can work across a broad range of problems with minimal problem specific adjustments or engineering. In this paper, we study this idea of generality in the locomotion domain. We develop a learning framework that can learn sophisticated locomotion behavior for a wide spectrum of legged robots, such as bipeds, tripeds, quadrupeds and hexapods, including wheeled variants. Our learning framework relies on a data-efficient, off-policy multi-task RL algorithm and a small set of reward functions that are semantically identical across robots. To underline the general applicability of the method, we keep the hyper-parameter settings and reward definitions constant across experiments and rely exclusively on on-board sensing. For nine different types of robots, including a real-world quadruped robot, we demonstrate that the same algorithm can rapidly learn diverse and reusable locomotion skills without any platform specific adjustments or additional instrumentation of the learning setup.},

Legged locomotion can dramatically expand the operational domains of robotics. However, conventional controllers for legged locomotion are based on elaborate state machines that explicitly trigger the execution of motion primitives and reflexes. These designs have escalated in complexity while falling short of the generality and robustness of animal locomotion. Here we present a radically robust controller for legged locomotion in challenging natural environments. We present a novel solution to incorporating proprioceptive feedback in locomotion control and demonstrate remarkable zero-shot generalization from simulation to natural environments. The controller is trained by reinforcement learning in simulation. It is based on a neural network that acts on a stream of proprioceptive signals. The trained controller has taken two generations of quadrupedal ANYmal robots to a variety of natural environments that are beyond the reach of prior published work in legged locomotion. The controller retains its robustness under conditions that have never been encountered during training: deformable terrain such as mud and snow, dynamic footholds such as rubble, and overground impediments such as thick vegetation and gushing water. The presented work opens new frontiers for robotics and indicates that radical robustness in natural environments can be achieved by training in much simpler domains.},

	abstract = {Legged robots pose one of the greatest challenges in robotics. Dynamic and agile maneuvers of animals cannot be imitated by existing methods that are crafted by humans. A compelling alternative is reinforcement learning, which requires minimal craftsmanship and promotes the natural evolution of a control policy. However, so far, reinforcement learning research for legged robots is mainly limited to simulation, and only few and comparably simple examples have been deployed on real systems. The primary reason is that training with real robots, particularly with dynamically balancing systems, is complicated and expensive. In the present work, we introduce a method for training a neural network policy in simulation and transferring it to a state-of-the-art legged system, thereby leveraging fast, automated, and cost-effective data generation schemes. The approach is applied to the ANYmal robot, a sophisticated medium-dog–sized quadrupedal system. Using policies trained in simulation, the quadrupedal machine achieves locomotion skills that go beyond what had been achieved with prior methods: ANYmal is capable of precisely and energy-efficiently following high-level body velocity commands, running faster than before, and recovering from falling even in complex configurations.
A method for learning agile control policies uses simulated data to enable precise, efficient movements in a complex physical robot.

	abstract = {This article surveys reinforcement learning from the perspective of optimization and control, with a focus on continuous control applications. It reviews the general formulation, terminology, and typical experimental implementations of reinforcement learning as well as competing solution paradigms. In order to compare the relative merits of various techniques, it presents a case study of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with unknown dynamics, perhaps the simplest and best-studied problem in optimal control. It also describes how merging techniques from learning theory and control can provide nonasymptotic characterizations of LQR performance and shows that these characterizations tend to match experimental behavior. In turn, when revisiting more complex applications, many of the observed phenomena in LQR persist. In particular, theory and experiment demonstrate the role and importance of models and the cost of generality in reinforcement learning algorithms. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the challenges in designing learning systems that safely and reliably interact with complex and uncertain environments and how tools from reinforcement learning and control might be combined to approach these challenges.},

In this paper, we aim to provide clarity and understanding on the role of dynamics randomization in learning robust locomotion policies for the Laikago quadruped robot. Surprisingly, in contrast to prior work with the same robot model, we find that direct sim-to-real transfer is possible without dynamics randomization or on-robot adaptation schemes. We conduct extensive ablation studies in a sim-to-sim setting to understand the key issues underlying successful policy transfer, including other design decisions that can impact policy robustness. We further ground our conclusions via sim-to-real experiments with various gaits, speeds, and stepping frequencies. Additional Details: https://www.pair.toronto.edu/understanding-dr/.},

In this paper, we devise a hierarchical learning framework, in which distinctive locomotion gaits and natural gait transitions emerge automatically with a simple reward of energy minimization. We use reinforcement learning to train a high-level gait policy that speciﬁes the contact schedules of each foot, while the low-level Model Predictive Controller (MPC) optimizes the motor torques so that the robot can walk at a desired velocity using that gait pattern. We test our learning framework on a quadruped robot and demonstrate automatic gait transitions, from walking to trotting and to ﬂy-trotting, as the robot increases its speed up to 2.5m/s (5 body lengths/s). We show that the learned hierarchical controller consumes much less energy across a wide range of locomotion speed than baseline controllers.},

	abstract = {To dynamically traverse challenging terrain, legged robots need to continually perceive and reason about upcoming features, adjust the locations and timings of future footfalls and leverage momentum strategically. We present a pipeline that enables ﬂexibly-parametrized trajectories for perceptive and dynamic quadruped locomotion to be optimized in an online, receding-horizon manner. The initial guess passed to the optimizer affects the computation needed to achieve convergence and the quality of the solution. We consider two methods for generating good guesses. The ﬁrst is a heuristic initializer which provides a simple guess and requires signiﬁcant optimization but is nonetheless suitable for adaptation to upcoming terrain. We demonstrate experiments using the ANYmal C quadruped, with fully onboard sensing and computation, to cross obstacles at moderate speeds using this technique. Our second approach uses latent-mode trajectory regression (LMTR) to imitate expert data—while avoiding invalid interpolations between distinct behaviors—such that minimal optimization is needed. This enables high-speed motions that make more expansive use of the robot’s capabilities. We demonstrate it on ﬂat ground with the real robot and provide numerical trials that progress toward deployment on terrain. These results illustrate a paradigm for advancing beyond short-horizon dynamic reactions, toward the type of intuitive and adaptive locomotion planning exhibited by animals and humans.},

	abstract = {Dynamic locomotion for legged robots is difﬁcult because the system dynamics are highly nonlinear and complex, nominally underactuated and unstable, multi-input and multioutput, as well as time-variant and hybrid. One usually faces the choice between the intricate full-body dynamics which remains computationally expensive and sometimes even intractable, and the empirically simpliﬁed model which inevitably limits the locomotion capability. In this paper, we explore the legged robot dynamics from a different perspective. By decomposing the robot into the body and the legs, with interaction forces and moments connecting them, we enjoy a novel method called Dynamic Model Decomposition that involves lower-dimensional dynamics for each subsystem while their composition maintaining the equivalence to the original full-order robot model. Based on that, we further propose a corresponding model predictive control framework via quadratic programming, which considers linearly approximated body dynamics with constrained leg reaction forces as inputs. The overall methodology was successfully applied to a planar ﬁve-link biped robot. The simulation results show that the robot is capable of body reference tracking, push recovery, velocity tracking, and even blind locomotion on fairly rough terrain. This suggests a promising dynamic motion control scheme in the future.},

	abstract = {This paper systematically decomposes a quadrupedal robot into bipeds to rapidly generate walking gaits and then recomposes these gaits to obtain quadrupedal locomotion. We begin by decomposing the full-order, nonlinear and hybrid dynamics of a three-dimensional quadrupedal robot, including its continuous and discrete dynamics, into two bipedal systems that are subject to external forces. Using the hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) framework, gaits for these bipedal robots can be rapidly generated (on the order of seconds) along with corresponding controllers. The decomposition is achieved in such a way that the bipedal walking gaits and controllers can be composed to yield dynamic walking gaits for the original quadrupedal robot --- the result is the rapid generation of dynamic quadruped gaits utilizing the full-order dynamics. This methodology is demonstrated through the rapid generation (3.96 seconds on average) of four stepping-in-place gaits and one diagonally symmetric ambling gait at 0.35 m/s on a quadrupedal robot --- the Vision 60, with 36 state variables and 12 control inputs --- both in simulation and through outdoor experiments. This suggested a new approach for fast quadrupedal trajectory planning using full-body dynamics, without the need for empirical model simplification, wherein methods from dynamic bipedal walking can be directly applied to quadrupeds.},

We overcome the arising challenges by building a model of the combined platform, ﬁtting the corresponding model parameters using experimental data and a straight-forward optimization framework. We use this model to generate control commands for the physical platform using trajectory optimization. We demonstrate that even with a simple model, and control trajectories deployed in a feedforward manner, the combined platform is capable of executing grasping tasks in a dynamic fashion. Furthermore, we show how the platform can use the additional degrees of freedom of the legs to extend the reachability of the arm.},

Concretely, this dual-resolution approach enables a global planner to explore the low-dimensional decomposed task-space regions toward the goal, then a local planner computes a path in high-dimensional constrained conﬁguration space.

However, when closing the loop, the performance and feasibility of the finite horizon optimal control problem solved at each control cycle is not guaranteed anymore. This is due to model discrepancies, the effect of low-level controllers, uncertainties and sensor noise. To address these issues, we propose a modified version of a standard MPC approach used in legged locomotion with viability (weak forward invariance) guarantees that ensures the feasibility of the optimal control problem. Moreover, we use past experimental data to find the best cost weights, which measure a combination of performance, constraint satisfaction robustness, or stability (invariance). These interpretable costs measure the trade off between robustness and performance. For this purpose, we use Bayesian optimization (BO) to systematically design experiments that help efficiently collect data to learn a cost function leading to robust performance. Our simulation results with different realistic disturbances (i.e. external pushes, unmodeled actuator dynamics and computational delay) show the effectiveness of our approach to create robust controllers for humanoid robots.},

The input to our framework consists of a set of objects placed in a known configuration, their target locations, and relative timing information describing when objects need to be picked up, optionally handed over, and dropped off. To allow robots to reason about the way in which grasping locations govern optimal motions, we formulate the problem using a multi-level optimization scheme: the top level optimizes grasping locations; the mid-layer level computes the configurations of the robot for pick, drop and handover states; and the bottom level computes optimal, collision-free motions. We leverage sensitivity analysis to compute derivatives analytically (how do grasping parameters affect IK solutions, and how these, in turn, affect motion trajectories etc.), and devise an efficient numerical solver to generate solutions to the resulting optimization problem.

	abstract = {This paper is about distributed derivative-based algorithms for solving optimization problems with a separable (potentially nonconvex) objective function and coupled affine constraints. A parallelizable method is proposed that combines ideas from the fields of sequential quadratic programming and augmented Lagrangian algorithms. The method negotiates shared dual variables that may be interpreted as prices, a concept employed in dual decomposition methods and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Here, each agent solves its own small-scale nonlinear programming problem and communicates with other agents by solving coupled quadratic programming problems. These coupled quadratic programming problems have equality constraints for which parallelizable methods are available. The use of techniques associated with standard sequential quadratic programming methods gives a method with superlinear or quadratic convergence rate under suitable conditions. This is in contrast to existing decomposition methods, such as ADMM, which have a linear convergence rate. It is shown how the proposed algorithm may be extended using globalization techniques that guarantee convergence to a local minimizer from any initial starting point.},

Our robotic system relies on an industrial, seven-degree-of freedom manipulator that can be both position- and impedance-controlled. In order to estimate a rough geometry of the target, continuous surface, we first generate a point cloud of the surface using an RGB-D camera, which is filtered to remove outliers and calibrated to the physical canvas surface. Then, our control algorithm physically reproduces digital drawing on the surface by impedance-controlling the manipulator. Our impedance-controlled drawing algorithm compensates for the uncertainty and incompleteness inherent to a point-cloud estimation of the drawing surface. Moreover, since drawing 2D vector pen art on a 3D surface requires surface parameterization that does not destroy the original 2D drawing, we rely on the least squares conformal mapping. Specifically, the conformal map reduces angle distortion during surface parameterization. As a result, our system can create distortion-free and complicated pen drawings on general surfaces with many unpredictable bumps robustly and faithfully.},

	abstract = {Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) has become a popular approach to performing trajectory optimization for complex, underactuated robots. However, DDP presents two practical challenges. First, the evaluation of dynamics derivatives during optimization creates a computational bottleneck, particularly in implementations that capture second-order dynamic effects. Second, constraints on the states (e.g., boundary conditions, collision constraints, etc.) require additional care since the state trajectory is implicitly deﬁned from the inputs and dynamics. This paper addresses both of these problems by building on recent work on Unscented Dynamic Programming (UDP)—which eliminates dynamics derivative computations in DDP—to support general nonlinear state and input constraints using an augmented Lagrangian. The resulting algorithm has the same computational cost as ﬁrst-order penalty-based DDP variants, but can achieve constraint satisfaction to high precision without the numerical ill-conditioning associated with penalty methods. We present results demonstrating its favorable performance on several simulated robot systems including a quadrotor and 7-DoF robot arm.},

However, it does not handle either state or control constraints. This paper presents a novel formulation of DDP that is able to accommodate arbitrary nonlinear inequality constraints on both state and control. The main insight in standard DDP is that a quadratic approximation of the value function can be derived using a recursive backward pass, however the recursive formulae are only valid for unconstrained problems. The main technical contribution of the presented method is a derivation of the recursive quadratic approximation formula in the presence of nonlinear constraints, after a set of active constraints has been identified at each point in time. This formula is used in a new Constrained-DDP (CDDP) algorithm that iteratively determines these active set and is guaranteed to converge toward a local minimum. CDDP is demonstrated on several underactuated optimal control problems up to 12D with obstacle avoidance and control constraints and is shown to outperform other methods for accommodating constraints.},

This paper introduces an approach to probabilistically fuse contact models, managing uncertainty in terrain geometry, dynamic modeling, and kinematics to improve the robustness of contact initiation at touchdown. A discrete-time extension of the generalized-momentum disturbance observer is presented to increase the accuracy of proprioceptive force control estimates. This information is fused with other contact priors under a framework of Kalman Filtering to increase robustness of the method. This approach results in accurate contact detection with 99.3 \% accuracy and a small 4-5ms delay. Using this new detector, an Event-Based Finite State Machine is implemented to deal with unexpected early and late contacts. This allows the robot to traverse cluttered environments by modifying the control actions for each individual leg based on the estimated contact state rather than adhering to a rigid time schedule regardless of actual contact state. Experiments with the MIT Cheetah 3 robot show the success of both the detection algorithm, as well as the Event-Based FSM while making unexpected contacts during trotting.},

In this work, we implement an optimization framework where both approaches for enforcing the system dynamics are available. We evaluate the performance of each approach for systems of varying complexity, and for domains with rigid contacts. Our tests revealed that formulations employing inverse dynamics converge faster, require less iterations, and are more robust to coarse problem discretization. These results suggest that inverse dynamics should be the preferred approach to enforce nonlinear system dynamics in simultaneous methods, such as direct transcription.},

	abstract = {This work presents a new control approach to multi-contact balancing for torque-controlled humanoid robots. The controller includes a non-strict task hierarchy, which allows the robot to use a subset of its end effectors for balancing while the remaining ones can be used for interacting with the environment. The controller creates a passive and compliant behavior for regulating the center of mass (CoM) location, hip orientation and the poses of each end effector assigned to the interaction task. This is achieved by applying a suitable wrench (force and torque) at each one of the end effectors used for interaction. The contact wrenches at the balancing end effectors are chosen such that the sum of the balancing and interaction wrenches produce the desired wrench at the CoM. The algorithm requires the solution of an optimization problem, which distributes the CoM wrench to the end effectors taking into account constraints for unilaterality, friction and position of the center of pressure. Furthermore, the feedback controller is combined with a feedforward control in order to improve performance while tracking a predeﬁned trajectory, leading to a control structure similar to a PD+ control. The controller is evaluated in several experiments with the humanoid robot TORO.},

	abstract = {Recently, the centroidal momentum dynamics has received substantial attention to plan dynamically consistent motions for robots with arms and legs in multi-contact scenarios. However, it is also non convex which renders any optimization approach difficult and timing is usually kept fixed in most trajectory optimization techniques to not introduce additional non convexities to the problem. But this can limit the versatility of the algorithms. In our previous work, we proposed a convex relaxation of the problem that allowed to efficiently compute momentum trajectories and contact forces. However, our approach could not minimize a desired angular momentum objective which seriously limited its applicability. Noticing that the non-convexity introduced by the time variables is of similar nature as the centroidal dynamics one, we propose two convex relaxations to the problem based on trust regions and soft constraints. The resulting approaches can compute time-optimized dynamically consistent trajectories sufficiently fast to make the approach realtime capable. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in several multi-contact scenarios for a humanoid robot. In particular, we show that the proposed convex relaxation of the original problem finds solutions that are consistent with the original non-convex problem and illustrate how timing optimization allows to find motion plans that would be difficult to plan with fixed timing.},

However, these models do not incorporate the robot’s angular momentum properties, a critical component of its dynamics. We introduce the Reaction Mass Pendulum (RMP) model, a 3D generalization of the better-known reaction wheel pendulum. The RMP model augments the existing models by compactly capturing the robot’s centroidal momenta through its composite rigid body (CRB) inertia. This model provides additional analytical insights into legged robot dynamics, especially for motions involving dominant rotation, and leads to a simpler class of control laws. In this paper we show how a humanoid robot of general geometry and dynamics can be mapped into its equivalent RMP model. A movement is subsequently mapped to the time evolution of the RMP. We also show how an “inertia shaping” control law can be designed based on the RMP. I.},

By allowing a simulation to fully explore the cost space offline, certain states and actions can be constrained or isolated. Data is fit with simple models relating the desired commands, optimal control actions, and robot states to identify new heuristic candidates. Basic parameter learning and adaptation laws are then applied to the models online.

Specifically, our goal is a control hierarchy in which highest-level behaviors are planned through reduced-order models, which describe the fundamental physics of legged locomotion, and lower level controllers utilize a learned policy that can bridge the gap between the idealized, simple model and the complex, full order robot. The high-level planner can use a model of the environment and be task specific, while the low-level learned controller can execute a wide range of motions so that it applies to many different tasks. In this letter we describe this learned dynamic walking controller and show that a range of walking motions from reduced-order models can be used as the command and primary training signal for learned policies. The resulting policies do not attempt to naively track the motion (as a traditional trajectory tracking controller would) but instead balance immediate motion tracking with long term stability. The resulting controller is demonstrated on a human scale, unconstrained, untethered bipedal robot at speeds up to 1.2 m/s.

	abstract = {The control of centroidal momentum has recently emerged as an important component of whole-body humanoid control, resulting in emergent upper-body motions and increased robustness to pushes when included in whole-body frameworks. Previous work has developed specialized computational algorithms for the centroidal momentum matrix (CMM) and its derivative, which relate rates of change in centroidal momentum to joint rates and accelerations of the humanoid. This paper instead shows that specialized algorithms are in fact not always required. Since the dynamics of the centroidal momentum are embedded in the joint-space dynamic equations of motion, the CMM and terms involving its derivative can be computed from the joint-space mass matrix and Coriolis terms. This new approach presents improvements in terms of its generality, compactness, and efficiency in comparison to previous specialized algorithms. The new computation method is then applied to perform whole-body control of a dynamic kicking motion, where the mass matrix and Coriolis terms are already required by the controller. This example motivates how centroidal momentum can be used as an aggregate descriptor of motion in order to ease whole-body motion authoring from a task-space perspective. It further demonstrates emergent upper-body motion from centroidal angular momentum (CAM) control that is shown to provide desirable regulation of the net yaw moment under the foot. Finally, a few perspectives are provided on the use of centroidal momentum control.},

Namely, we apply control for rotation through the speciﬁcation and execution of speciﬁc desired ‘rotation indices’ for whole-body orientation, angular velocity and angular momentum control and highlight the use of the angular excursion as a means for whole-body rotation control. We account for the stylistic components of behaviors through reference posture control. The novelty of the described work includes control over behaviors with considerable rotational components, both on the ground and in the air as well as a number of characteristics useful for general control, such as ﬂight planning with inertia modeling, compliant posture tracking, and contact control planning.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new robust, dynamic quadruped, the MIT Cheetah 3. Like its predecessor, the Cheetah 3 exploits tailored mechanical design to enable simple control strategies for dynamic locomotion and features high-bandwidth proprioceptive actuators to manage physical interaction with the environment. A new leg design is presented that includes proprioceptive actuation on the abduction/adduction degrees of freedom in addition to an expanded range of motion on the hips and knees. To make full use of these new capabilities, general balance and locomotion controllers for Cheetah 3 are presented. These controllers are embedded into a modular control architecture that allows the robot to handle unexpected terrain disturbances through reactive gait modification and without the need for external sensors or prior environment knowledge. The efficiency of the robot is demonstrated by a low Cost of Transport (CoT) over multiple gaits at moderate speeds, with the lowest CoT of 0.45 found during trotting. Experiments showcase the ability to blindly climb up stairs as a result of the full system integration. These results collectively represent a promising step toward a platform capable of generalized dynamic legged locomotion.},

The discussion begins with the kinematics of an anthropomorphic mechanism, followed by the equation of motion of the system and the contact mechanics that accompanies with the motions. Some compact representations of both the robot dynamics and the contact mechanics are summarized. The former is referred to as the centroidal dynamics derived from the total momenta of the system, while the latter includes the contact wrench sum and the zero-moment point. They are naturally joined as a reduced-order dynamics model derived from an approximate relationship between the center of mass and the zero-moment point. Finally, some techniques to synthesize the intended motion into the joint actuation torques under limitations of contact forces are shown. This is basically a translation of a Japanese version with some modifications and reorganizations.},

Unfortunately, current control methods still lack the ability to move with the agility and robustness needed to traverse arbitrary terrains with the same grace and reliability as animals. This dissertation presents the successful implementation of a novel nonlinear optimization-based Regularized Predictive Control (RPC) framework that optimizes robot states, footstep locations, and ground reaction forces over a future prediction horizon. RPC exploits expertly designed and data-driven extracted heuristics by directly embedding them in the optimization through regularization in the cost function. Well-designed regularization should bias results towards a "good enough" heuristic solution by shaping the cost space favorably, while allowing the optimization to find a better result if it exists.},

To accurately model the robot’s dynamics over a long horizon, we introduce a loss function that tracks the model’s prediction over multiple timesteps. We adapt model predictive control to account for planning latency, which allows the learned model to be used for real time control. Additionally, to ensure safe exploration during model learning, we embed prior knowledge of leg trajectories into the action space. The resulting system achieves fast and robust locomotion. Unlike model-free methods, which optimize for a particular task, our planner can use the same learned dynamics for various tasks, simply by changing the reward function.1 To the best of our knowledge, our approach is more than an order of magnitude more sample efﬁcient than current model-free methods.},

It leads to a more general formulation of DDP, enabling for example the use of the faster recursive Newton-Euler inverse dynamics. We leverage the implicit formulation for precise and exact contact modelling in DDP, where we focus on two contributions: (1) Contact dynamics in acceleration level that enables high-order integration schemes; (2) Formulation using an invertible contact model in the forward pass and a closed form solution in the backward pass to improve the numerical resolution of contacts. The performance of the proposed framework is validated (1) by comparing implicit versus explicit DDP for the swing-up of a double pendulum, and (2) by planning motions for two tasks using a single leg model making multi-body contacts with the environment: standing up from ground, where a priori contact enumeration is challenging, and maintaining balance under an external perturbation.},

We extend TOWR with analytical costs to generate trajectories that a state-of-the-art whole-body tracking controller can successfully execute. To reduce online computation time, we implement a learning-based scheme for initialization of the nonlinear program based on offline experience. The execution of trajectories as long as 16 footsteps and 5.5 s over different terrains by a real quadruped demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on hardware.

	abstract = {The Sequential Linear Quadratic (SLQ) algorithm is a continuous-time variant of the well-known Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) technique with a Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation. This family of methods has gained popularity in the robotics community due to its efficiency in solving complex trajectory optimization problems. However, one major drawback of DDP-based formulations is their inability to properly incorporate path constraints. In this paper, we address this issue by devising a constrained SLQ algorithm that handles a mixture of constraints with a previously implemented projection technique and a new augmented-Lagrangian approach. By providing an appropriate multiplier update law, and by solving a single inner and outer loop iteration, we are able to retrieve suboptimal solutions at rates suitable for real-time model-predictive control applications. We particularly focus on the inequality-constrained case, where three augmented-Lagrangian penalty functions are introduced, along with their corresponding multiplier update rules. These are then benchmarked against a relaxed log-barrier formulation in a cart-pole swing up example, an obstacle-avoidance task, and an object-pushing task with a quadrupedal mobile manipulator.},

	abstract = {Recently, Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) and other similar algorithms have become the solvers of choice when performing non-linear Model Predictive Control (nMPC) with modern robotic devices. The reason is that they have a lower computational cost per iteration when compared with off-the-shelf Non-Linear Programming (NLP) solvers, which enables its online operation. However, they cannot handle constraints, and are known to have poor convergence capabilities. In this paper, we propose a method to solve the optimal control problem with control bounds through a squashing function (i.e., a sigmoid, which is bounded by construction). It has been shown that a naive use of squashing functions damage the convergence rate. To tackle this, we ﬁrst propose to add a quadratic barrier that avoids the difﬁculty of the plateau produced by the sigmoid. Second, we add an outer loop that adapts both the sigmoid and the barrier; it makes the optimal control problem with the squashing function converge to the original control-bounded problem. To validate our method, we present simulation results for different types of platforms including a multi-rotor, a biped, a quadruped and a humanoid robot.},

	abstract = {Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is an indirect method for trajectory optimization. Its efficiency derives from the exploitation of temporal structure (inherent to optimal control problems) and explicit roll-out/integration of the system dynamics. However, it suffers from numerical instability and, when compared to direct methods, it has limited initialization options (allows initialization of controls, but not of states) and lacks proper handling of control constraints. These limitations are due to the fact that DDP is a single shooting algorithm. In this work, we tackle these issues with a direct-indirect hybridization approach that is primarily driven by the dynamic feasibility of the optimal control problem. Our feasibility search emulates the numerical resolution of a direct transcription problem with only dynamics constraints, namely a multiple shooting formulation. We show that our approach has better numerical convergence than BOX-DDP (a shooting method), and that its convergence rate and runtime performance are competitive with state-of-the-art direct transcription formulations solved using the interior point and active set algorithms available in KNITRO. We further show that our approach decreases the dynamic feasibility error monotonically -- as in state-of-the-art nonlinear programming algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of our hybrid approach by generating complex and athletic motions for quadruped and humanoid robots.},

A Gaussian distribution is first obtained from an iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) solver. A short horizon Model Predictive Control (MPC) is then used to track this distribution. We show that tracking a distribution is more cost-efficient and robust as compared to tracking the mean or using iLQR feedback control.

This allows the simultaneous optimization of the contact forces, contact timings, continuous motion trajectories and compliance, while satisfying task constraints.

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a trajectory generation method for robotic systems with contact kinematics and force constraints based on optimal control and reachability analysis tools. Normally, the dynamics and constraints of a contact-constrained robot are nonlinear and coupled to each other. Instead of linearizing the model and constraints, we solve the optimal control problem directly to obtain feasible state trajectories and their corresponding control inputs. A tractable optimal control problem is formulated and subsequently addressed by dual approaches, which rely on sampling-based dynamic programming and rigorous reachability analysis tools. In particular, a sampling-based method together with a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process solution approach are used to break down the end-to-end trajectory generation problem by generating a sequence of subregions that the system’s trajectory will have to pass through to reach its final destination. The distinctive characteristic of the proposed trajectory optimization algorithm is its ability to handle the intricate contact constraints, coupled with the system dynamics, in a computationally efficient way. We validate our method using extensive numerical simulations with two legged robots.},

Existing work considered models ranging from intuitive physics and physical simulators to contact dynamics models used in robotic manipulation and locomotion. In this work we propose descriptions of physics which directly allow us to leverage optimization methods for physical reasoning and sequential manipulation planning. The proposed multi-physics formulation enables the solver to mix various levels of abstraction and simplifications for different objects and phases of the solution. As an essential ingredient, we propose a specific parameterization of wrench exchange between object surfaces in a path optimization framework, introducing the point-of-attack as decision variable. We demonstrate the approach on various robot manipulation planning problems, such as grasping a stick in order to push or lift another object to a target, shifting and grasping a book from a shelve, and throwing an object to bounce towards a target.},

The key elements for this success are threefold. First, optimal control over a receding horizon is implemented with Crocoddyl, an optimal control library based on differential dynamics programming, providing state-feedback control in less than 10 msecs. Second, a warm start strategy based on memory of motion has been implemented to overcome the sensitivity of the optimal control solver to initial conditions. Finally, the optimal trajectories are executed by a low-level torque controller, feedbacking on direct torque measurement at high frequency. This paper provides the details of the method, along with analytical benchmarks with the real humanoid robot Talos.},

On the other hand, the proposed SCvx-based approach combines the advantages of direct and shooting methods for CITO. For evaluations, we consider non-prehensile manipulation tasks. The proposed method is compared to a version based on iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) on a planar example. The results demonstrate that both methods can find physically-consistent motions that complete the tasks without a meaningful initial guess owing to the VSCM. The proposed SCvx-based method outperforms the iLQR-based method in terms of convergence, computation time, and the quality of motions found. Finally, the proposed SCvx-based method is tested on a standard robot platform and shown to perform efficiently for a real-world application.},

The forward dynamics of a 27-dof humanoid with 10 contacts are evaluated in 0.1 msec. Since the simulation is stable at 10 msec timesteps, it can run 100 times faster than real-time on a single core of a desktop processor. Furthermore the entire simulation pipeline can be inverted analytically, an order-ofmagnitude faster than the corresponding forward dynamics. We soften all constraints, in a way that avoids instabilities and unrealistic penetrations associated with earlier spring-damper methods and yet is sufﬁcient to allow inversion. Constraints are imposed via impulses, using an extended version of the velocitystepping approach. For holomonic constraints the extension involves a soft version of the Gauss principle. For all other constraints we extend our earlier work on complementarity-free contact dynamics – which were already known to be invertible via an iterative solver – and develop a new formulation allowing analytical inversion.},

	abstract = {Multibody simulation with frictional contact has been a challenging subject of research for the past thirty years. Rigid-body assumptions are commonly used to approximate the physics of contact, and together with Coulomb friction, lead to challenging-to-solve nonlinear complementarity problems (NCP). On the other hand, robot grippers often introduce significant compliance. Compliant contact, combined with regularized friction, can be modeled entirely with ODEs, avoiding NCP solves. Unfortunately, regularized friction introduces high-frequency stiff dynamics and even implicit methods struggle with these systems, especially during slip-stick transitions. To improve the performance of implicit integration for these systems we introduce a Transition-Aware Line Search (TALS), which greatly improves the convergence of the Newton-Raphson iterations performed by implicit integrators. We find that TALS works best with semi-implicit integration, but that the explicit treatment of normal compliance can be problematic. To address this, we develop a Transition-Aware Modified Semi-Implicit (TAMSI) integrator that has similar computational cost to semi-implicit methods but implicitly couples compliant contact forces, leading to a more robust method. We evaluate the robustness, accuracy and performance of TAMSI and demonstrate our approach alongside relevant sim-to-real manipulation tasks.},

This paper proposes a global optimization model for this problem with alternated-sticking contact, referred to as Contact-Trajectory Optimization. We achieve this by reasoning on simpliﬁed geometric environments with a quasi-dynamic relaxation of the physics. These relaxations are the result of approximating bilinear torque effects and deprecating high-order forces and impacts. Moreover, we apply convex approximations that retain the fundamental properties of rigid multi-contact interaction. As result, we derive a mixedinteger convex model that provides global optimality, infeasibility detection and convergence guarantees. This approach does not require seeding and accounts for the shapes of the object and environment. We validate this approach with extensive simulated and real-robot experiments, demonstrating its ability to quickly and reliably optimize multi-contact manipulation behaviors.},

We use this model to develop a fast approximation to solve the inverse problem: estimating the contact patch when the sensor is deformed by arbitrary objects. This inverse model can be easily identiﬁed through experiments and is formulated as a sparse Quadratic Program (QP) that can be solved efﬁciently online. The proposed model serves as the ﬁrst stage of a pose estimation pipeline for robot manipulation. We demonstrate the proposed inverse model through real-time estimation of contact patches on a contact-rich manipulation problem in which oversized ﬁngers screw a nut onto a bolt, and as part of a complete pipeline for ICP-based pose-estimation and tracking. Our results demonstrate a path towards realizing soft robots with highly compliant surfaces that perform complex real-world manipulation tasks.},

The systems are with independent dynamics and objectives but coupling constraints due to collision avoidance requirements. The goal is to develop an algorithm that locally solves subproblems while minimizing an overall objective in a cooperative distributed way. The proposed approach is based on the decomposition-coordination iterations of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In particular, we separate the variables into two sets: one concerned with collision avoidance constraints, and the other concerned with local problems; and add consensus constraints for these two. Local subproblems can be solved fully in parallel. Furthermore, optimization problems are formulated and solved in a receding horizon way. Successive linearizations of nonlinear vessel dynamics as well as the non-convex collision avoidance constraints about a shifted optimal trajectory from a previous step are implemented to maintain a trade-off between computational complexity and optimality. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for cooperative distributed collision avoidance.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a multi-block generalized alternating direction method of multiplier (GADMM) algorithm for minimizing a linearly constrained separable nonconvex and possibly nonsmooth optimization problem. The GADMM generalizes the classical ADMM by including proximal terms in each primal updates and an over-relaxation parameter in the dual update. We prove that any limit point of the sequence is a critical point. By introducing a modified augmented Lagrangian we show that the sequence generated by the GADMM is bounded and the norm of the difference of consecutive terms approaches to zero. Under the powerful \{K{\textbackslash}L\} properties we show that the GADMM sequence has a finite length and converges to a stationary point, and we drive its convergence rate. Given a proper lower-semicontinuous function \$f:{\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}n{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}mathbb R\$ and a critical point \$x{\textasciicircum}*{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}n\$, the \{K{\textbackslash}L\} property asserts that there exists a continuous concave monotonically increasing function \${\textbackslash}psi\$ such that around \$x{\textasciicircum}*\$ it holds \${\textbackslash}psi'(f(x)-f(x{\textasciicircum}*)){\textbackslash}cdot\{{\textbackslash}rm dist\}(0,{\textbackslash}partial f(x)){\textbackslash}ge 1\$ . When \${\textbackslash}psi(s)=s{\textasciicircum}\{1-{\textbackslash}theta\}\$ with \${\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash}in[0,1]\$ this is equivalent to \${\textbar}f(x)-f(x{\textasciicircum}*){\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}theta\}\{{\textbackslash}rm dist\}(0,{\textbackslash}partial f(x)){\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ to remain bounded around \$x{\textasciicircum}*\$. We show that if \${\textbackslash}theta=0\$, the sequence generated by GADMM converges in a finite numbers of iterations. If \${\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash}in(0,1/2]\$, then the rate of convergence is \$cQ{\textasciicircum}\{k\}\$ where \$c{\textgreater}0\$, \$Q{\textbackslash}in(0,1)\$, and \$k{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb N\$ is the iteration number.

	abstract = {Effective collaboration is based on online adaptation of one's own actions to the actions of their partner. This article provides a principled formalism to address online adaptation in joint planning problems such as Dyadic collaborative Manipulation (DcM) scenarios. We propose an efficient bilevel formulation that combines graph search methods with trajectory optimization, enabling robotic agents to adapt their policy on-the-fly in accordance to changes of the dyadic task. This method is the first to empower agents with the ability to plan online in hybrid spaces; optimizing over discrete contact locations, contact sequence patterns, continuous trajectories, and force profiles for co-manipulation tasks. This is particularly important in large object co-manipulation that requires changes of grasp-holds and plan adaptation. We demonstrate in simulation and with robot experiments the efficacy of the bilevel optimization by investigating the effect of robot policy changes in response to real-time alterations of the dyadic goals, eminent grasp switches, as well as optimal dyadic interactions to realize the joint task.},

	abstract = {Locomotion planning for legged systems requires reasoning about suitable contact schedules. The contact sequence and timings constitute a hybrid dynamical system and prescribe a subset of achievable motions. State-of-the-art approaches cast motion planning as an optimal control problem. In order to decrease computational complexity, one common strategy separates footstep planning from motion optimization and plans contacts using heuristics. In this paper, we propose to learn contact schedule selection from high-level task descriptors using Bayesian Optimization. A bi-level optimization is defined in which a Gaussian Process model predicts the performance of trajectories generated by a motion planning nonlinear program. The agent, therefore, retains the ability to reason about suitable contact schedules, while explicit computation of the corresponding gradients is avoided. We delineate the algorithm in its general form and provide results for planning single-legged hopping. Our method is capable of learning contact schedule transitions that align with human intuition. It performs competitively against a heuristic baseline in predicting task appropriate contact schedules.},

	abstract = {In the control of bipedal locomotion, linear velocity of the center of mass has been widely accepted as a primary variable for summarizing a robot's state vector. The ubiquitous massless-legged linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model is based on it. In this paper, we argue that angular momentum about the contact point has several properties that make it superior to linear velocity for feedback control. So as not to confuse the benefits of angular momentum with any other control design decisions, we first reformulate the standard LIP controller in terms of angular momentum. We then implement the resulting feedback controller on the 20 degree-of-freedom bipedal robot, Cassie Blue, where each leg accounts for nearly one-third of the robot's total mass of 35{\textasciitilde}Kg. Under this controller, the robot achieves fast walking, rapid turning while walking, large disturbance rejection, and locomotion on rough terrain. The reasoning developed in the paper is applicable to other control design philosophies, whether they be Hybrid Zero Dynamics or Reinforcement Learning.},

The key idea of our method is approximating the feasibility of an arm contact as its sustainability during a bipedal walking cycle, which we call “geometrical feasibility”. First, we plan a global path by RB-RRT with the reachability model and discretize it using footstep planning. In order to find sustainable contacts, we compute the intersections between the reachability volumes and environments along the planned footsteps, which are defined as contactable areas, and define contact candidates inside these intersections. Then, we prioritize possible contact sets based on their contactable areas and expected supportability. We pass these contact sets to whole-body motion planning process according to their priorities, and evaluate static equilibrium and kinematic constraints to generate quasi-static contact transitions. We apply the proposed system to four different simulation experiments, and conclude that it is a reasonable solution for the difficulty in predicting “feasible” arm contacts, which contributes to improving multi-contact capability of locomotion planning for a humanoid robot.},

The algorithm is based on an extension of the alternating direction method of multipliers to problems with three separable functions in the objective function. One of the main advantages of the proposed algorithm is that its memory requirements grow linearly with the prediction horizon of the controller. Its sparse implementation is attained by identification of the particular structure of the optimization problem, and not by employing the common sparse algebra techniques, leading to a very computationally efficient implementation. We describe the controller formulation and provide a detailed description of the proposed algorithm, including its pseudocode. We also provide a simple (and sparse) warmstarting procedure that can significantly reduce the number of iterations. Finally, we show some preliminary numerical results of the performance of the algorithm.},

	abstract = {Locomotion of legged robots on arbitrary terrain using multiple contacts is yet an open problem. To tackle it, a common approach is to rely on reduced template models (e.g. the linear inverted pendulum). However, most of existing template models are based on some restrictive hypotheses that limit their range of applications. Moreover, reduced models are generally not able to cope with the constraints of the robot complete model, such as the kinematic limits. In this paper, we propose a complete solution relying on a generic template model, based on the centroidal dynamics, able to quickly compute multi-contact locomotion trajectories for any legged robot on arbitrary terrains. The template model relies on exact dynamics and is thus not limited by arbitrary assumption. We also propose a generic procedure to handle feasibility constraints due to the robot whole body as occupancy measures, and a systematic way to approximate them using off-line learning in simulation. An efﬁcient solver is ﬁnally obtained by introducing an original second-order approximation of the centroidal wrench cone. The effectiveness and the versatility of the approach is demonstrated in several multi-contact scenarios with two humanoid robots both in reality and in simulation.},

Specifically, we propose a novel contact model that can be computed in closed-form, satisfies friction cone constraints and can be embedded into direct trajectory optimization frameworks without complementarity constraints. The closed-form solution decouples the computation of the contact forces from other actuation forces and this property is used to formulate a minimal direct optimization problem expressed with configuration variables only. Our simulation study demonstrates the advantages over the rigid contact model and a trajectory optimization approach based on complementarity constraints. The proposed model enables physics-based optimization for a wide range of interactions with hard, slippery, and soft grounds in a unified manner expressed by two parameters only. By computing trotting and jumping motions for a quadruped robot, the proposed optimization demonstrates the versatility for multi-contact motion planning on surfaces with different physical properties.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for planning and control of legged robot locomotion. Given the desired contact sequence, this method generates gaits and dynamic motions for legged robots without resorting to simpliﬁed stability criteria. The method uses direct collocation for searching for solutions within the constraint-consistent subspace deﬁned by the robot’s contact conﬁguration. For the differential equation constraints of the collocation algorithm, we use the so-called direct dynamics of a constrained multibody system. The dynamics of a legged robot is different for each contact conﬁguration. Our method deals with such a hybrid nature, and it allows for velocity discontinuities when contacts are made. We introduce the projected impact dynamics constraint to enforce consistency during mode switching. We stabilize the plan using an inverse dynamics controller compatible with the optimal feed-forward control of the motion plan. As a whole, this approach reduces the complexity associated with specifying dynamic motions of a ﬂoating-base robot under the constant inﬂuence of contact forces. We apply this method on a hydraulically-actuated quadruped robot. We show two types of gaits (walking and trotting) as well as diverse jumping motions (forward, sideways, turning) on the real system. The results presented here are one of the few examples of an optimal control problem solved and satisfactorily transferred to a real torquecontrolled legged robot.},

Further, a Relaxed Barrier (ReB) method is used to manage inequality constraints and is integrated into HS-DDP for locomotion planning. The performance of the developed algorithms is benchmarked on a simulation model of the MIT Mini Cheetah executing a bounding gait.

By allowing a simulation to fully explore the cost space ofﬂine, certain states and actions can be constrained or isolated. Data is ﬁt with simple models relating the desired commands, optimal control actions, and robot states to identify new heuristic candidates. Basic parameter learning and adaptation laws are then applied to the models online. This method extracts simple, but powerful heuristics that can approximate complex dynamics and account for errors stemming from model simpliﬁcations and parameter uncertainty without the loss of physical intuition while generalizing the parameter tuning process.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11433},
	abstract = {We introduce an approximate model for predicting the net contact wrench between nominally rigid objects for use in simulation, control, and state estimation. The model combines and generalizes two ideas: a bed of springs (an "elastic foundation") and hydrostatic pressure. In this model, continuous pressure fields are computed offline for the interior of each nominally rigid object. Unlike hydrostatics or elastic foundations, the pressure fields need not satisfy mechanical equilibrium conditions. When two objects nominally overlap, a contact surface is defined where the two pressure fields are equal. This static pressure is supplemented with a dissipative rate-dependent pressure and friction to determine tractions on the contact surface. The contact wrench between pairs of objects is an integral of traction contributions over this surface. The model evaluates much faster than elasticity-theory models, while showing the essential trends of force, moment, and stiffness increase with contact load. It yields continuous wrenches even for non-convex objects and coarse meshes. The method shows promise as sufficiently fast, accurate, and robust for design-in-simulation of robot controllers.},

They have important benefits but to the best of our knowledge have never been implemented on a torque controlled humanoid where model inaccuracies, sensor noise and real-time computation requirements can be problematic. Using a reformulation of existing algorithms, we propose a simplification of the problem that allows to achieve real-time control. Momentum-based control is integrated in the task hierarchy and a LQR design approach is used to compute the desired associated closed-loop behavior and improve performance. Extensive experiments on various balancing and tracking tasks show very robust performance in the face of unknown disturbances, even when the humanoid is standing on one foot. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical inverse dynamics together with momentum control can be efficiently used for feedback control under real robot conditions.},

	abstract = {It is nowadays well-established that locomotion can be written as a large and complex optimal control problem. Yet, current knowledge in numerical solver fails to directly solve it. A common approach is to cut the dimensionality by relying on reduced models (inverted pendulum, capture points, centroidal). However it is difficult both to account for whole-body constraints at the reduced level and also to define what is an acceptable trade-off at the whole-body level between tracking the reduced solution or searching for a new one. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a rigorous mathematical framework based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, to enforce the consensus between the centroidal state dynamics at reduced and whole-body level. We propose an exact splitting of the whole-body optimal control problem between the centroidal dynamics (under-actuation) and the manipulator dynamics (full actuation), corresponding to a re-arrangement of the equations already stated in previous works. We then describe with details how alternating descent is a good solution to implement an effective locomotion solver. We validate this approach in simulation with walking experiments on the HRP-2 robot.},

However, for more complex tasks the assumptions of these models can become limiting. For example, the LIPM does not allow for the control of contact forces independently, is limited to co-planar contacts and assumes that the angular momentum is zero. In this paper, we propose to use the full momentum equations of a humanoid robot in a trajectory optimization framework to plan its center of mass, linear and angular momentum trajectories. The model also allows for planning desired contact forces for each end-effector in arbitrary contact locations. We extend our previous results on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) design for momentum control by computing the (linearized) optimal momentum feedback law in a receding horizon fashion. The resulting desired momentum and the associated feedback law are then used in a hierarchical whole body control approach. Simulation experiments show that the approach is computationally fast and is able to generate plans for locomotion on complex terrains while demonstrating good tracking performance for the full humanoid control.},

	abstract = {To plan dynamic, whole-body motions for robots, one conventionally faces the choice between a complex, fullbody dynamic model containing every link and actuator of the robot, or a highly simpliﬁed model of the robot as a point mass. In this paper we explore a powerful middle ground between these extremes. We exploit the fact that while the full dynamics of humanoid robots are complicated, their centroidal dynamics (the evolution of the angular momentum and the center of mass (COM) position) are much simpler. By treating the dynamics of the robot in centroidal form and directly optimizing the joint trajectories for the actuated degrees of freedom, we arrive at a method that enjoys simpler dynamics, while still having the expressiveness required to handle kinematic constraints such as collision avoidance or reaching to a target. We further require that the robot’s COM and angular momentum as computed from the joint trajectories match those given by the centroidal dynamics. This ensures that the dynamics considered by our optimization are equivalent to the full dynamics of the robot, provided that the robot’s actuators can supply sufﬁcient torque. We demonstrate that this algorithm is capable of generating highly-dynamic motion plans with examples of a humanoid robot negotiating obstacle course elements and gait optimization for a quadrupedal robot. Additionally, we show that we can plan without pre-specifying the contact sequence by exploiting the complementarity conditions between contact forces and contact distance.},

In contrast, we propose to compute the whole-body trajectory by using a local optimal control solver, namely Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). Our method produces more efficient motions, with lower forces and smaller impacts, by exploiting the Angular Momentum (AM). With this aim, we propose an original DDP formulation exploiting the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker constraint of the rigid contact model.

Regarding the former, our derivation employs a constrained version of Bellman's principle of optimality, by introducing a set of auxiliary slack variables in the backward pass. In parallel, we show how Augmented Lagrangian methods can be naturally incorporated within DDP, by utilizing a particular set of penalty-Lagrangian functions that preserve second-order differentiability.

To date, we support Single Shooting, the iterative Linear-Quadratic Regulator, Gauss-Newton Multiple Shooting and classical Direct Multiple Shooting. We provide interfaces to general purpose NLP solvers and Riccati-based linear-quadratic optimal control solvers. The CT was designed to solve large-scale optimal control and estimation problems efficiently and allows for online control of dynamic systems. Some of the key features to enable fast run-time performance are full compatibility with Automatic Differentiation, derivative code generation, and multi-threading. Still, the CT is designed as a modular framework whose building blocks can also be used for other control and estimation applications such as inverse dynamics control, extended Kalman filters or kinematic planning.

	abstract = {Direct methods for trajectory optimization are widely used for planning locally optimal trajectories of robotic systems. Many critical tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation, often involve impacting the ground or objects in the environment. Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics that result from impacts as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning of rigid-body systems that contact their environment through inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction. This method eliminates the requirement for a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm poses the optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints. We leverage Sequential Quadratic Programming to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory that satisfies the complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high-dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes. We demonstrate the approach on four increasingly complex systems: rotating a pinned object with a finger, simple grasping and manipulation, planar walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high-speed bipedal running on the FastRunner platform.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02177},
	abstract = {In this work we apply Douglas-Rachford splitting to a homogeneous embedding of the linear complementarity problem (LCP). The homogeneous embedding converts LCPs into non-linear monotone complementarity problems (MCPs) that encode both the optimality conditions of the original LCP as well as certificates of infeasibility. The resulting problem can be expressed as the problem of finding a zero of the sum of two maximal monotone operators, to which we apply operator splitting. The resulting algorithm has almost identical per-iteration cost as applying Douglas-Rachford splitting to the LCP directly. Specifically it requires solving a linear system and projecting onto a cone at every iteration. Previous work applied operator splitting to a homogeneous embedding of a linear cone optimization problem. This paper extends the analysis to cover quadratic objectives, due to the correspondence between quadratic programming and the linear complementarity problem. Our algorithm is able to return a primal-dual solution to the quadratic cone program should one exist, or a certificate of infeasibility otherwise. We provide extensive numerical experimentation to show that for feasible problems our approach tends to be somewhat faster than applying operator splitting directly to the LCP, and in cases of infeasibility our approach can be orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches based on differences of iterates.},

In contrast to most previous methods, the proposed approach is fast while still using a full dynamic model. Additionally, the approach is contact model free. Instead contact forces are added to the Optimal Control formulation as additional control inputs and contact constraints are handled using a relaxation approach.

In this paper, we (i) survey current state-of-the-art software implementations of the key rigid body dynamics algorithms (RBDL, Pinocchio, Rigid-BodyDynamics.jl, and RobCoGen), (ii) establish a methodology for benchmarking these algorithms, and (iii) characterize their performance through real measurements taken on a modern hardware platform. With this analysis, we aim to provide direction for future improvements that will need to be made to enable emerging techniques for real-time robot motion control. To this end, we are also releasing our suite of benchmarks to enable others to help contribute to this important task.},

Such controllers often rely heavily upon heuristics or, due to the combinatoric structure in the dynamics, are unsuitable for real-time control. Principled deployment of tactile sensors offers a promising mechanism for stable and robust control, but modern approaches often use this data in an ad hoc manner, for instance to guide guarded moves. In this work, by exploiting the complementarity structure of contact dynamics, we propose a control framework which can close the loop on rich, tactile sensors. Critically, this framework is non-combinatoric, enabling optimization algorithms to automatically synthesize provably stable control policies. We demonstrate this approach on three different underactuated, multi-contact robotics problems.},

The key feature of the algorithm is that it can adapt to the accuracy requirements of a task, by slowing down and generating “careful” motion when the task requires high accuracy, and by speeding up and moving fast when the task tolerates inaccuracy. We formulate the problem as an MDP with action-dependent stochasticity and propose an approximate online solution to it. We use a trajectory optimizer with a deterministic model to suggest promising actions to the MDP, to reduce computation time spent on evaluating different actions. We conducted experiments in simulation and on a real robotic system. Our results show that with a task-adaptive planning and control approach, a robot can choose fast or slow actions depending on the task accuracy and uncertainty level. The robot makes these decisions online and is able to maintain high success rates while completing manipulation tasks as fast as possible.},

The resulting algorithm is faster than NI-based methods and as robust as CO-based ones (100\% success rate), as confirmed by extensive numerical evaluations.

The identiﬁcation experiments are carried out on-site, in a quick, non-invasive way using a CA8335 Qualistar three-phase electrical networks analyser. Next, the collected data is compared with a parametrised dynamic robot model in an optimisation routine. This routine results in the speciﬁcation of a parametric dynamic robot model. The model is used as a dynamic constraint for a model predictive control problem, where other physical constraints are added i.e. the limited workspace and the constraints on the joint velocities and accelerations. A sequential quadratic programming solver is used to minimise a mechanical energy based cost function. The resulting energy-optimal path is translated into custom robot commands executable on an industrial robot. The systematic methodology is validated on an IRB1600 industrial ABB robot performing a custom pick-andplace operation. The obtained dynamic robot model is given and compared to the collected measurements. To demonstrate the possibility of energy saving by ‘intelligently’ programming a robot trajectory the energy and time-optimal paths are generated taking all physical constraints into account. Simulation results show a signiﬁcant time and energy improvement (up to 5\%) compared to most trajectories generated by the ABB software. The most remarkable result is that the fastest energy-optimal trajectory turns out to be 4\% more energy eﬃcient and 3\% faster then the commercially available fastest trajectory. Additional stand-still experiments show that activation of the brakes is favoured over an actuated stand-still from an energy point of view, assuming that the start-up time when releasing the brakes is limited.},

This is particularly problematic when an expensive robot is strong enough to break itself. In this paper, we demonstrate that simple heuristics used to enforce limits (clamping and penalizing) are not efficient in general. We then propose a generalization of DDP which accommodates box inequality constraints on the controls, without significantly sacrificing convergence quality or computational effort. We apply our algorithm to three simulated problems, including the 36-DoF HRP-2 robot. A movie of our results can be found here goo.gl/eeiMnn.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to performing in-grasp manipulation: the problem of moving an object with reference to the palm from an initial pose to a goal pose without breaking or making contacts. Our method to perform in-grasp manipulation uses kinematic trajectory optimization which requires no knowledge of dynamic properties of the object. We implement our approach on an Allegro robot hand and perform thorough experiments on ten objects from the YCB dataset. The proposed method is general enough to generate motions for most objects the robot can grasp. Experimental results support the feasibillty of its application across a variety of object shapes. We explore the adaptability of our approach to additional task requirements by including collision avoidance and joint space smoothness costs. The grasped object avoids collisions with the environment by the use of a signed distance cost function. We reduce the effects of unmodeled object dynamics by requiring smooth joint trajectories. We additionally compensate for errors encountered during trajectory execution by formulating an object pose feedback controller.},

The approach is based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation, where the goal is to find an optimal sequence of robot motions to achieve a desired object motion. Due to the multiple contact modes associated with frictional interactions, the resulting optimization program suffers from combinatorial complexity when tasked with determining the optimal sequence of modes. To overcome this difficulty, we formulate the search for the optimal mode sequences offline, separately from the search for optimal control inputs online. Using tools from machine learning, this leads to a convex hybrid MPC program that can be solved in real-time. We validate our algorithm on a planar manipulation experimental setup where results show that the convex hybrid MPC formulation with learned modes achieves good closed-loop performance on a trajectory tracking problem.},

In recent years, a variety of contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithms have been developed that avoid the pitfalls of mode pre-speciﬁcation by simultaneously optimizing state, input, and contact force trajectories. However, their reliance on ﬁrst-order integrators leads to a linear tradeoff between optimization problem size and plan accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a new family of trajectory optimization algorithms that leverage ideas from discrete variational mechanics to derive higher-order generalizations of the classic time-stepping method of Stewart and Trinkle. By using these dynamics formulations as constraints in direct trajectory optimization algorithms, it is possible to perform contact-implicit trajectory optimization with signiﬁcantly higher accuracy. For concreteness, we derive a second-order method and evaluate it using several simulated rigid body systems including an underactuated biped and a quadruped.},

Interactions with the environment are integral parts of these motions, and a priori unscheduled contact sequences are discovered by the solver itself, opportunistically making or breaking contacts with the ground through feet, knees, hips, elbows, and hands. The present investigation analyzes the effects on the computational performance of: 1) the explicit introduction of contact forces among the optimization variables, 2) the substitution of undesired contact forces with geometric constraints that prevent interpenetrations, and 3) the splitting of the planning problem into two consecutive phases of increasing complexity.

Planning an approach trajectory for grasping in such situations can beneﬁt from physics-based simulations that describe the dynamics of the interaction between the robot manipulator and the environment. In this work, we present a physics-based trajectory optimization approach for planning grasp approach trajectories. We present novel cost objectives and identify failure modes relevant to grasping in cluttered environments. Our approach uses rollouts of physics-based simulations to compute the gradient of the objective and of the dynamics. Our approach naturally generates behaviors such as choosing to push objects that are less likely to topple over, recognizing and avoiding situations which might cause a cascade of objects to fall over, and adjusting the manipulator trajectory to push objects aside in a direction orthogonal to the grasping direction. We present results in simulation for grasping in a variety of cluttered environments with varying levels of density of obstacles in the environment. Our experiments in simulation indicate that our approach outperforms a baseline approach that considers multiple straight-line trajectories modiﬁed to account for static obstacles by an aggregate success rate of 14\% with varying degrees of object clutter.},

In case of any changes in the environment, slow re-planning is required. We propose a TAMP algorithm that optimizes over Cartesian frames defined relative to target objects. The resulting plan then remains valid even if the objects are moving and can be executed by reactive controllers that adapt to these changes in real time. We apply our TAMP framework to a torque-controlled robot in a pick and place setting and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing environments, inaccurate perception, and imprecise control, both in simulation and the real world.},

While optimization of continuous control trajectories is well developed, many applications require both discrete and continuous, i.e. hybrid controls. Finding an optimal sequence of hybrid controls is challenging due to the exponential explosion of discrete control combinations. Our method, based on Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), circumvents this problem by incorporating discrete actions inside DDP: we ﬁrst optimize continuous mixtures of discrete actions, and, subsequently force the mixtures into fully discrete actions. Moreover, we show how our approach can be extended to partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) for trajectory planning under uncertainty. We validate the approach in a car driving problem where the robot has to switch discrete gears and in a box pushing application where the robot can switch the side of the box to push. The pose and the friction parameters of the pushed box are initially unknown and only indirectly observable.},

	abstract = {The center of mass (CoM) of a humanoid robot occupies a special place in its dynamics. As the location of its effective total mass, and consequently, the point of resultant action of gravity, the CoM is also the point where the robot’s aggregate linear momentum and angular momentum are naturally defined. The overarching purpose of this paper is to refocus our attention to centroidal dynamics: the dynamics of a humanoid robot projected at its CoM. In this paper we specifically study the properties, structure and computation schemes for the centroidal momentum matrix (CMM), which projects the generalized velocities of a humanoid robot to its spatial centroidal momentum. Through a transformation diagram we graphically show the relationship between this matrix and the well-known joint-space inertia matrix. We also introduce the new concept of “average spatial velocity” of the humanoid that encompasses both linear and angular components and results in a novel decomposition of the kinetic energy. Further, we develop a very efficient

algorithm, expressed in a compact form using spatial notation, for computing the CMM, centroidal momentum, centroidal inertia, and average spatial velocity. Finally, as a practical use of centroidal dynamics we show that a momentum-based balance controller that directly employs the CMM can significantly reduce unnecessary trunk bending during balance maintenance against external disturbance.},

	title = {An efficient and versatile framework for multi-contact optimal control},
	abstract = {We introduce Crocoddyl (Contact RObot COntrol by Differential DYnamic Library), an open-source framework tailored for efﬁcient multi-contact optimal control. Crocoddyl efﬁciently computes the state trajectory and the control policy for a given predeﬁned sequence of contacts. Its efﬁciency is due to the use of sparse analytical derivatives, exploitation of the problem structure, and data sharing. It employs differential geometry to properly describe the state of any geometrical system, e.g. ﬂoating-base systems. Additionally, we propose a novel multipleshooting method called Feasibility-prone Differential Dynamic Programming (FDDP). However, our method does not add extra decision variables which often increases the computation time per iteration due to factorization. Our novel method shows a greater globalization strategy compared to classical Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithms. Concretely, we propose two modiﬁcations to the classical DDP algorithm. First, the backward pass accepts infeasible state-control trajectories. Second, the rollout keeps the gaps open during the early “exploratory” iterations (as expected in multiple-shooting methods with only equality constraints). We showcase the performance of our framework using different tasks. With our method, we can compute highlydynamic maneuvers for legged robots (e.g. jumping, front-ﬂip) in the order of milliseconds.},

	abstract = {The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is now widely used in many fields, and its convergence was proved when two blocks of variables are alternatively updated. It is strongly desirable and practically valuable to extend the ADMM directly to the case of a multi-block convex minimization problem where its objective function is the sum of more than two separable convex functions. However, the convergence of this extension has been missing for a long time—neither an affirmative convergence proof nor an example showing its divergence is known in the literature. In this paper we give a negative answer to this long-standing open question: The direct extension of ADMM is not necessarily convergent. We present a sufficient condition to ensure the convergence of the direct extension of ADMM, and give an example to show its divergence.},

	abstract = {The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is widely used to solve large-scale linearly constrained optimization problems, convex or nonconvex, in many engineering fields. However there is a general lack of theoretical understanding of the algorithm when the objective function is nonconvex. In this paper we analyze the convergence of the ADMM for solving certain nonconvex consensus and sharing problems, and show that the classical ADMM converges to the set of stationary solutions, provided that the penalty parameter in the augmented Lagrangian is chosen to be sufficiently large. For the sharing problems, we show that the ADMM is convergent regardless of the number of variable blocks. Our analysis does not impose any assumptions on the iterates generated by the algorithm, and is broadly applicable to many ADMM variants involving proximal update rules and various flexible block selection rules.},

	abstract = {This paper is an introductory tutorial for numerical trajectory optimization with a focus on direct collocation methods. These methods are relatively simple to understand and effectively solve a wide variety of trajectory optimization problems. Throughout the paper we illustrate each new set of concepts by working through a sequence of four example problems. We start by using trapezoidal collocation to solve a simple one-dimensional toy problem and work up to using Hermite--Simpson collocation to compute the optimal gait for a bipedal walking robot. Along the way, we cover basic debugging strategies and guidelines for posing well-behaved optimization problems. The paper concludes with a short overview of other methods for trajectory optimization. We also provide an electronic supplement that contains well-documented MATLAB code for all examples and methods presented. Our primary goal is to provide the reader with the resources necessary to understand and successfully implement their own direct collocation methods. (An erratum is attached.)},
